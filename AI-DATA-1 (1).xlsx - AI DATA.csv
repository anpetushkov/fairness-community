The themes included opportunities such as leveraging big data and improving interventions; barriers to adoption such as confusion regarding AI's applicability, limited capacity, and poor data quality; and risks such as propagation of bias, exacerbation of inequity, hype, and poor regulation.,Experts are cautiously optimistic about AI's impacts on public health practice, particularly for improving disease surveillance. However, they perceived substantial barriers, such as a lack of available expertise, and risks, including inadequate regulation. Therefore, investment and research into AI for public health practice would likely be beneficial.

The LASSO guided feature selection included demographics, comorbidities, home medications, vital signs. We constructed a logistic regression-based ML algorithm to predict ""severe"" COVID-19, defined as patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or died in or out-of-hospital. Training data included 1,469 adult patients who tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 14 days of acute care. We performed: 1) temporal validation in 414 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 2) validation in a PUI set of 13,271 patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 test during an acute care visit, and 3) real-time validation in 2,174 ED patients with PUI test or positive SARS-CoV-2 result. Subgroup analysis was conducted across race and gender to ensure equity in performance.,The algorithm performed well on pre-implementation validations for predicting COVID-19 severity: 1) the temporal validation had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.87 (95%-CI: 0.83, 0.91); 2) validation in the PUI population had an AUROC of 0.82 (95%-CI: 0.81, 0.83).

In this work, we consider how to incorporate group fairness constraints into kernel regression methods, applicable to Gaussian processes, support vector machines, neural network regression and decision tree regression. Further, we focus on examining the effect of incorporating these constraints in decision tree regression, with direct applications to random forests and boosted trees amongst other widespread popular inference techniques. We show that the order of complexity of memory and computation is preserved for such models and tightly binds the expected perturbations to the model in terms of the number of leaves of the trees. Importantly, the approach works on trained models and hence can be easily applied to models in current use and group labels are only required on training data.","machine learning, algorithmic fairness, kernel methods, constrained learning, Gaussian process, decision tree, neural network",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7515270/,1,1,Europe,4,2019,20,1,UK Royal Academy of Engineering and the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitive Finance,Entropy (Basel),algorithmic fairness; constrained learning; decision tree; machine learning; neural network,0,white,UK,4,University of Oxford,PhD,0,1,white,UK,4,Northampton University,PhD,0,,"UK,UK,UK,UK","4, 4, 4, 4",4,4,4,1,1,"Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford,Faculty of Business and Law, Northampton University","PhD,PhD, PhD, PhD, ","0, 0, 0, 0",Algeria,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UK,UK,UK,UK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, asian, white, white",3,0,0,1,0,4,4,0,75%,

Research suggests that cultural diversity within organizations can increase team potency and performance, yet this theory has not been explored in the field of surgery. Furthermore, when surveyed, patients express a desire for their care provider to mirror their own race and ethnicity. In the present study, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between a high ranking by the US News and World Report for gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) surgery and greater racial, ethnic, and gender diversity among the physicians and surgeons.,We used the 2019 US News and World Report rankings for best hospitals by specialty to categorize gastroenterology and GI surgery departments into 2 groups: 1-50 and 51-100. Hospital websites of these top 100 were viewed to determine if racial diversity and inclusion were highlighted in the hospitals' core values or mission statements. To determine the rates of diversity within departments, Betaface (Betaface.com) facial analysis software was used to analyze photos taken from the hospitals' websites. This software was able to determine the race, ethnicity, and gender of the care providers. We examined the racial and ethnic makeup of the populations served by these hospitals to see if the gastroenterologists and surgeons adequately represented the state population. We then ran the independent samples t-test to determine if there was a difference in rankings of more diverse departments.,Hospitals with gastroenterology and GI surgery departments in the top 50 were more likely to mention diversity on their websites compared with hospitals that ranked from 51-100 (76% versus 56%; P = 0.035). The top 50 hospitals had a statistically significant higher percentage of underrepresented minority GI physicians and surgeons (7.01% versus 4.04%; P < 0.001). In the 31 states where these hospitals were located, there were more African Americans (13% versus 3%; P < 0.001) and Hispanics (12% versus 2%; P < 0.001), while there were fewer Asians (4% versus 21%; P < 0.001) in the population compared with the faculty.,We used artificial intelligence software to determine the degree of racial and ethnic diversity in gastroenterology and GI surgery departments across the county. Higher ranking hospitals had a greater degree of diversity of their faculty and were more likely to emphasize diversity in their mission statements. Hospitals stress the importance of having a culturally diverse staff, yet their care providers may not adequately reflect the populations they serve. Further work is needed to prospectively track diversity rates over time and correlate these changes with measurable outcomes.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33750544/,1,1,USA,4,2021,1,1,,Journal of surgical research,"race, gender, selection bias,Diversity",0,white,USA,4,University of Alabama at Birmingham,MPH,0,1,black,USA,4,University of Alabama at Birmingham,MD,0,,"USA,USA,USA,USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham","MPH,MD,MD,MD","0,1,0,0",Andorra,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, -, -, white, black",2,1,0,0,2,5,5,0,40%,

As machine learning methods become more common in health care settings, it is important to ensure that these methods do not contribute to racial disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial groups.,The goal of the research was to assess a machine learning algorithm intentionally developed to minimize bias in in-hospital mortality predictions between white and nonwhite patient groups.,Bias was minimized through preprocessing of algorithm training data. We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a large academic health center between 2001 and 2012, drawing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. Patients were included if they had at least 10 hours of available measurements after ICU admission, had at least one of every measurement used for model prediction, and had recorded race/ethnicity data. Bias was assessed through the equal opportunity difference. Model performance in terms of bias and accuracy was compared with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE).,The machine learning algorithm was found to be more accurate than all comparators, with a higher sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic. The machine learning algorithm was found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.016, P=.20). APACHE was also found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.019, P=.11), while SAPS II and MEWS were found to have significant bias (equal opportunity difference 0.038, P=.006 and equal opportunity difference 0.074, P<.001, respectively).,This study indicates there may be significant racial bias in commonly used severity scoring systems and that machine learning algorithms may reduce bias while improving on the accuracy of these methods.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7644374/,1,1,USA,4,2020,15,0,,JMIR public health and surveillance,"health disparities;  racial disparities,bias",1,white,USA,4,"Dascena, Inc,",MA,0,1,asian,USA,4,Cape Regional Medical Center,MD,1,,"USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA, USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",13,13,13,1,1,"Dascena, Inc,Cabell Huntington Hospital, Marshall University School of Medicine,Kidney Care and Transplant Associates of New England,Division of Critical Care Medicine, Cooper University Hospital/Cooper Medical School of Rowan University,Cape Regional Medical Center","MA,PhD,PhD,MD,MD,MD","0,0,0,0,0,1",Angola,0,13,13,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, asian",12,0,0,1,0,13,13,0,92%,

It is important to develop a platform that enables searching for disability data to expose systemic discrimination and social exclusion, which increase vulnerability to inequitable social conditions.,Our project aims to create an accessible and multilingual pilot disability website that structures and integrates data about people with disabilities and provides data for national and international disability advocacy communities. The platform will be endowed with a document upload function with hybrid (automated and manual) paragraph tagging, while the querying function will involve an intelligent natural language search in the supported languages.,We have designed and implemented a virtual community platform using Wikibase, Semantic Web, machine learning, and web programming tools to enable disability communities to upload and search for disability documents. The platform data model is based on an ontology we have designed following the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The virtual community facilitates the uploading and sharing of validated information, and supports disability rights advocacy by enabling dissemination of knowledge.,Using health informatics and artificial intelligence techniques (namely Semantic Web, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques), we were able to develop a pilot virtual community that supports disability rights advocacy by facilitating uploading, sharing, and accessing disability data. The system consists of a website on top of a Wikibase (a Semantic Web-based datastore). The virtual community accepts 4 types of users: information producers, information consumers, validators, and administrators. The virtual community enables the uploading of documents, semiautomatic tagging of their paragraphs with meaningful keywords, and validation of the process before uploading the data to the disability Wikibase. Once uploaded, public users (information consumers) can perform a semantic search using an intelligent and multilingual search engine (QAnswer). Further enhancements of the platform are planned.,The platform ontology is flexible and can accommodate advocacy reports and disability policy and legislation from specific jurisdictions, which can be accessed in relation to the CRPD articles. The platform ontology can be expanded to fit international contexts. The virtual community supports information upload and search.

The total sample consisted of 430 respondents, broken into two sets of subgroups: women (n = 171) and men (n = 259), and whites (n = 239) and underrepresented minorities (n = 74). Asian students were removed from analyses when comparisons were made by race-ethnicity, but were included in the analyses for all students and those comparing men and women. Student's t-tests were used to identify differences between gender and racial-ethnic groups in mean responses to seven survey items, and effect sizes were used to characterize the magnitudes and practical significances of the differences. Forward stepwise regression was conducted to determine the best predictive models for each student subgroup and for the total sample; the subgroup models were compared with each other as well as with the total-sample model.,Cross-validation of the gender and race-ethnicity models showed that the men's satisfaction and the women's satisfaction were predicted equally well using either subgroup's model, and that the white students' satisfaction and the underrepresented-minority students' satisfaction were predicted equally well using either subgroup's model. Furthermore, the total-sample model, employing a subset of five predictors, was similar in its predictive power to the subgroup models.,The study's findings suggest that curriculum structure (timely feedback and the promotion of critical thinking) and students' perceptions of the priority faculty place on students' education are prominent predictors of student satisfaction (across all subgroups) with the learning environment. In contrast, students' perceptions of the learning environment as a comfortable place for all gender and racial-ethnic groups, although less prominent predictors of satisfaction, will discriminate among the subgroups.","College Environment, College Students, Curriculum Evaluation, Educational Assessment, Educational Environment, Higher Education, Medical Schools, Medical Students, Minority Groups, Student Attitudes, Student School Relationship, Teacher Student Relationship",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-predictive-model-of-student-satisfaction-with-the-Robins-Gruppen/1f3e76c823ba358954494d650c181d4615baebf3,1,1,North America,4,1997,82,0,,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,"learning environment, student satisfaction",1,white,USA,4,"University of Michigan Medical School,",MD,0,1,white,USA,4,"University of Michigan Medical School,",MD,0,,"USA,USA,USA,USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,University of Michigan Medical School,"MD, MD, MD, MD, PHD","0,0,0,0,0",Argentina,14,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white,-,white,white",4,0,0,0,1,5,5,0,80%,

The CHR Model (County Health Rankings Model) weights socioeconomic factors, lifestyle behaviors, and physical environment factors collectively at 80% in driving impact on health outcomes, to the 20% weight for access to and quality of clinical care. Commercial determinants of health affect everyone today and unhealthy choices worsen pre-existing economic, social, and racial inequities. Yet there is a disproportionate focus on therapeutic intervention to the exclusion of shaping patient behaviors to improve healthcare. If the recent pandemic taught us a critically important lesson, it is the imperative to look beyond clinical care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), long-standing systemic health and social inequities put various groups of people at higher risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19, including many racial and ethnic minority groups. The virus was simply more efficient in detecting such vulnerabilities than the guardians of these physiologies. These insights from the pandemic come at the heel of a confluence of three major accelerants that may radically reshape our approaches to hot-spotting vulnerabilities and managing them before they manifest in a derangement or disease. They are the recent strides in behavioral economics and behavior science; advances in remote monitoring and personal health technologies; and developments in artificial intelligence and data sciences.

Similarly, successful applications of CP may have transformative effects on how we categorise and classify mental disorders and mental health. Since many mental disorders go along with disturbed conscious experiences, it is desirable that successful applications of CP improve our understanding of disorders involving disruptions in conscious experience.

However, AI and ML should also be used cautiously, due to potential issues of fairness and algorithmic bias that may arise if not applied properly. Furthermore, populations in LMICs can be particularly vulnerable to bias and fairness in AI algorithms, due to a lack of technical capacity, existing social bias against minority groups, and a lack of legal protections. In order to address the need for better guidance within the context of global health, we describe three basic criteria (Appropriateness, Fairness, and Bias) that can be used to help evaluate the use of machine learning and AI systems: 1) APPROPRIATENESS is the process of deciding how the algorithm should be used in the local context, and properly matching the machine learning model to the target population; 2) BIAS is a systematic tendency in a model to favor one demographic group vs another, which can be mitigated but can lead to unfairness; and 3) FAIRNESS involves examining the impact on various demographic groups and choosing one of several mathematical definitions of group fairness that will adequately satisfy the desired set of legal, cultural, and ethical requirements. Finally, we illustrate how these principles can be applied using a case study of machine learning applied to the diagnosis and screening of pulmonary disease in Pune, India.

After applying the algorithm, subpopulation calibration statistics were greatly improved, with the variance of the calibration-in-the-large values across all subpopulations reduced by 98.8% and 94.3% in the PCE and FRAX models, respectively.,Prediction models in medicine are increasingly common. Calibration, the agreement between predicted and observed risks, is commonly poor for subpopulations that were underrepresented in the development set of the models, resulting in bias and reduced performance for these subpopulations.

As the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, cardiovascular disease is prevalent across all populations, with clear benefit to operationalise clinical and biomedical data to improve workflow, quality of patient care, and lower costs. AI technologies are designed to aid accurate decisions, without the bias of external factors‚Äîa pitfall of human errors. However, AI algorithms are still subject to their own biases.
 A particular challenge in cardiovascular medicine and the application of AI technology is in the intrinsic and extrinsic biases that affect quality control, and thus clinical outcomes. First, there is considerable heterogeneity in the quality of diagnostic studies and how they are done. For example, echocardiography is subject to both the operator doing the study and the interpreter analysing the study. Other cardiac imaging technologies, such as cardiac MRI, are not standardised in protocol, and vary by institution and machine vendor. These variabilities pose a challenge to the AI system, in which their learned ground truth is dependent on these human interpretations.1 Current studies using AI in cardiac imaging and diagnostics show great promise;2, 3, 4 however, these studies might be limited to sample sizes at institutional or regionally distributed levels, or have not yet been externally validated by operators outside of the study or used on a separate population.1
 Second, in machine learning models in which algorithms are designed to recognise patterns, there is a tendency to overfit the dataset because of an inability to distinguish a true contributing factor from noise.5 Thus, an overfitted model might show high performance in the training data that is then not applicable when shown a new dataset. In the training stage of the AI algorithm, it is thus essential to validate the algorithm in an independent dataset after the training is completed.
 Additionally, data processing requires regular annotation by trained clinicians to assist with quality control. The process is time consuming, and there is risk for the annotator to contribute their bias, either consciously or subconsciously, into the algorithm. Especially in AI-automated diagnostic procedures, there are often differing opinions among cardiologists. Annotations that might be perceived as significant by some, might be considered erroneous by others. The ideal process for annotating AI data would be through the consensus of multiple cardiologists; however, this would be an extremely expensive and time consuming approach.
 Another significant concern regarding the use of predictive AI models is the risk to worsen health disparities through biases in the data training the algorithm, and in the algorithm's intent. Women and minority groups are historically under-represented in cardiology, and the bulk of current evidence-based medicine might not necessarily apply to these populations. A systematic review of 207 trials found consistent under-reporting of female and Black patients from 2001 to 2018.6 Although the same proportion of women and men present with chest pain, men are 2¬∑5 times more likely to be referred to a cardiologist for management than women.7 Black patients in the emergency room are 40% less likely to receive pain medication than White patients.8 These inequalities are preserved in troves of health data, which are being used to train AI algorithms. Obermeyer and colleagues9 found that use of a widely used commercial prediction algorithm resulted in significant racial bias in predicting outcomes. Specifically, the algorithm identified White patients to have higher risk scores and were more often selected to receive additional care than Black patients who were equally as sick. In a study by Nordling and colleagues,10 a machine learning algorithm identified the patient's postcode as the number one predictor for prolonged hospital stay, correlating to areas of low income and predominantly Black neighbourhoods. From these findings, another ethical dilemma arises in using an algorithm for decision making. If the algorithm was designed to optimise hospital resources, high-income White patients might be selected to receive the majority of hospital resources, further deepening the divide in access to care for minority and underserved groups.","AI, bias, cardiovascular medicine, cardiac imaging, women, minorities",https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30249-1/fulltext,1,1,North America,4,2020,21,1,Duke Clinical Research Institute,The Lancet.

However, due to its inherent complexity, AL presents two major measurement challenges to conventional statistical modeling (the field's dominant methodology): it is comprised of a complex causal network of bioallostatic systems, represented by an even larger set of dynamic biomarkers; and, it is situated within a web of antecedent socioecological systems, linking AL to differences in health outcomes and disparities. To address these challenges, we employed case-based computational modeling (CBM), which allowed us to make four advances: (1) we developed a multisystem, 7-factor (20 biomarker) model of AL's network of allostatic systems; (2) used it to create a catalog of nine different clinical AL profiles (causal pathways); (3) linked each clinical profile to a typology of 23 health outcomes; and (4) explored our results (post hoc) as a function of gender, a key socioecological factor. In terms of highlights, (a) the Healthy clinical profile had few health risks; (b) the pro-inflammatory profile linked to high blood pressure and diabetes; (c) Low Stress Hormones linked to heart disease, TIA/Stroke, diabetes, and circulation problems; and (d) high stress hormones linked to heart disease and high blood pressure.

These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients' pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Here we use a deep learning approach to measure the severity of osteoarthritis, by using knee X-rays to predict patients' experienced pain. We show that this approach dramatically reduces unexplained racial disparities in pain. Relative to standard measures of severity graded by radiologists, which accounted for only 9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 3-16%) of racial disparities in pain, algorithmic predictions accounted for 43% of disparities, or 4.7√ó more (95% CI, 3.2-11.8√ó), with similar results for lower-income and less-educated patients. This suggests that much of underserved patients' pain stems from factors within the knee not reflected in standard radiographic measures of severity. We show that the algorithm's ability to reduce unexplained disparities is rooted in the racial and socioeconomic diversity of the training set. Because algorithmic severity measures better capture underserved patients' pain, and severity measures influence treatment decisions, algorithmic predictions could potentially redress disparities in access to treatments like arthroplasty.",,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01192-7,1,1,North America,4,2021,77,1,US social security administration,Nature medicine,"algorithmic severity measures,underserved patients' pain",0,white,USA,4,Stanford University,PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,University of California at Berkeley,PhD,0,,"USA,USA,USA,USA,USA","4,4,4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"Stanford University,Harvard University,University of Chicago,University of California at Berkeley","PhD,PhD,PhD,PhD","0,0,0,0",Bolivia,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white,white,white,white, white",5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,100%,

In the last years, data generation has outstripped data analysis and while many studies focused on specific aspects of the disease, a global picture of the disease is not yet accomplished. Here, we analyzed and compared a collection of gene expression information from healthy individuals and from patients suffering under different arthritis conditions from published studies containing the following clinical conditions: early and established rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and arthralgia. We show comprehensive overviews of this data collection and give new insights specifically on gene expression in the early stage, into sex-dependent gene expression, and we describe general differences in expression of different biotypes of genes. Many genes that are related to cytoskeleton changes (actin filament related genes) are differently expressed in early rheumatoid arthritis in comparison to healthy subjects; interestingly, eight of these genes reverse their expression ratio significantly between men and women compared early rheumatoid arthritis and healthy subjects. There are some slighter changes between men and woman between the conditions early and established rheumatoid arthritis. Another aspect are miRNAs and other gene biotypes which are not only promising candidates for diagnoses but also change their expression grossly in average at rheumatoid arthritis and arthralgia compared to the healthy condition. With a selection of intersecting genes, we were able to generate simple classification models to distinguish between healthy and rheumatoid arthritis as well as between early rheumatoid arthritis to other arthritides based on gene expression.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31344123/,1,0,Austria,4,2019,13,0,,PLoS One,"Rheumatoid arthritis, gene expression, sex-dependent, gender, byotypes",1,white,Austria,4,Medical University of Vienna,PhD,0,1,white,Austria,4,Medical University of Vienna,MD,0,,"Austria, Alemanha,Austria,Austria,Austria","4,4,4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"Medical University of Vienna, UNIKA-T, Technical University and Helmholtz Zentrum München- Augsburg, Germany,  Medical University of Vienna,  Medical University of Vienna, Medical University of Vienna","PhD,MD,MD,MD,MD","0,0,0,0,0",Bosnia and Herzegovina,1,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Austria,Germany,Austria,Austria,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white,white, white, white, white",5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,100%,

However, this revolutionary technological field raises various complex ethical challenges. The objective of this systematic scoping review is to document the current uses of AI in dentistry and the ethical concerns or challenges they imply. Three health care databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], SciVerse Scopus, and Cochrane Library) and 2 computer science databases (ArXiv, IEEE Xplore) were searched. After identifying 1,553 records, the documents were filtered, and a full-text screening was performed. In total, 178 studies were retained and analyzed by 8 researchers specialized in dentistry, AI, and ethics. The team used Covidence for data extraction and Dedoose for the identification of ethics-related information. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Among the included studies, 130 (73.0%) studies were published after 2016, and 93 (52.2%) were published in journals specialized in computer sciences. The technologies used were neural learning techniques for 75 (42.1%), traditional learning techniques for 76 (42.7%), or a combination of several technologies for 20 (11.2%). Overall, 7 countries contributed to 109 (61.2%) studies. A total of 53 different applications of AI in dentistry were identified, involving most dental specialties. The use of initial data sets for internal validation was reported in 152 (85.4%) studies. Forty-five ethical issues (related to the use AI in dentistry) were reported in 22 (12.4%) studies around 6 principles: prudence (10 times), equity (8), privacy (8), responsibility (6), democratic participation (4), and solidarity (4). The ratio of studies mentioning AI-related ethical issues has remained similar in the past years, showing that there is no increasing interest in the field of dentistry on this topic. This study confirms the growing presence of AI in dentistry and highlights a current lack of information on the ethical challenges surrounding its use. In addition, the scarcity of studies sharing their code could prevent future replications. The authors formulate recommendations to contribute to a more responsible use of AI technologies in dentistry.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34060359/,1,1,Canada,4,2021,10,0,,"

AI in the forms of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Expert Systems, Planning and Logistics methods, and Image Processing networks provide great analytical aptitude. While AI methods were first conceptualized for radiology, investigations today are established across all medical specialties. The necessity for proper infrastructure, skilled labor, and access to large, well-organized data sets has kept the majority of medical AI applications in higher-income countries. However, critical technological improvements, such as cloud computing and the near-ubiquity of smartphones, have paved the way for use of medical AI applications in resource-poor areas. Global health initiatives (GHI) have already begun to explore ways to leverage medical AI technologies to detect and mitigate public health inequities. For example, AI tools can help optimize vaccine delivery and community healthcare worker routes, thus enabling limited resources to have a maximal impact. Other promising AI tools have demonstrated an ability to: predict burn healing time from smartphone photos; track regions of socioeconomic disparity combined with environmental trends to predict communicable disease outbreaks; and accurately predict pregnancy complications such as birth asphyxia in low resource settings with limited patient clinical data. In this commentary, we discuss the current state of AI-driven GHI and explore relevant lessons from past technology-centered GHI. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework to guide the development of sustainable strategies for AI-driven GHI, and we outline areas for future research.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32123635/,1,0,USA,4,2020,12,0,,"

The trustworthiness of AI for medical decision making in global health and low-resource settings is hampered by insufficient data diversity, nontransparent AI algorithms, and resource-poor health institutions' limited participation in AI production and validation. RAD-AID's three-pronged integrated strategy for AI adoption in resource-poor health institutions is presented, which includes clinical radiology education, infrastructure implementation, and phased AI introduction. This strategy derives from RAD-AID's more-than-a-decade experience as a nonprofit organization developing radiology in resource-poor health institutions, both in the United States and in low- and middle-income countries. The three components synergistically provide the foundation to address health care disparities. Local radiology personnel expertise is augmented through comprehensive education. Software, hardware, and radiologic and networking infrastructure enables radiology workflows incorporating AI.

The impact of AI on health outcomes and inequalities calls for health professionals and data scientists to make a collaborative effort to ensure historic health disparities are not encoded into the future. We present a study that evaluates bias in existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models used in psychiatry and discuss how these biases may widen health inequalities. Our approach systematically evaluates each stage of model development to explore how biases arise from a clinical, data science and linguistic perspective.,A literature review of the uses of NLP in mental health was carried out across multiple disciplinary databases with defined Mesh terms and keywords. Our primary analysis evaluated biases within 'GloVe' and 'Word2Vec' word embeddings. Euclidean distances were measured to assess relationships between psychiatric terms and demographic labels, and vector similarity functions were used to solve analogy questions relating to mental health.,Our primary analysis of mental health terminology in GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings demonstrated significant biases with respect to religion, race, gender, nationality, sexuality and age. Our literature review returned 52 papers, of which none addressed all the areas of possible bias that we identify in model development. In addition, only one article existed on more than one research database, demonstrating the isolation of research within disciplinary silos and inhibiting cross-disciplinary collaboration or communication.,Our findings are relevant to professionals who wish to minimize the health inequalities that may arise as a result of AI and data-driven algorithms.

We report current applications of AI in plastic surgery and possible future applications based on published literature and continuing scientific studies, and detail its potential limitations and ethical considerations.,Current machine learning models using convolutional neural networks can evaluate breast mammography and differentiate benign and malignant tumours as accurately as specialist doctors, and motion sensor surgical instruments can collate real-time data to advise intraoperative technical adjustments. Centralised big data portals are expected to collate large datasets to accelerate understanding of disease pathogeneses and best practices. Information obtained using computer vision could guide intraoperative surgical decisions in unprecedented detail and semi-autonomous surgical systems guided by AI algorithms may enable improved surgical outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Surgeons must collaborate with computer scientists to ensure that AI algorithms inform clinically relevant health objectives and are interpretable.

In response, an emerging field called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to increase the interpretability, fairness, and transparency of machine learning. In this paper, we describe how cognitive psychologists can make contributions to XAI. The human mind is also a black box, and cognitive psychologists have over 150 years of experience modeling it through experimentation. We ought to translate the methods and rigor of cognitive psychology to the study of artificial black boxes in the service of explainability. We provide a review of XAI for psychologists, arguing that current methods possess a blind spot that can be complemented by the experimental cognitive tradition.

AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective?,Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed.,Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).,The ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.",,https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00577-8,1,1,Canada,4,2021,37,0,-,BMC Medical Ethics,"Ethics;  health conditions, Public and population health.",0,white,Canada,4,"Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto","PhD,",0,0,white,Canada,4,"Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto,",PhD,0,,"Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Pakistani, Canada, Canada","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4",9,9,9,1,1,"Joint Centre for Bioethics, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Bridgepoint Collaboratory for Research and Innovation, Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health System, 1 Bridgepoint Drive, Toronto, Gerstein Science Information Centre, University of Toronto, ","PhD, PhD, MD, MSc, MPH, PhD, MSc, MISt, PhD",0,Central African Republic,0,9,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Pakistan,Canada,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white, white, asian, asian, asian, white",6,0,0,3,0,9,9,0,67%,

Artificial intelligence applications could assist in achieving the above. The World Health Organization and global healthcare systems have already recognized the use of artificial intelligence technologies to address 'system gaps' and automate some of the more cumbersome tasks to optimize clinical services and reduce health inequalities. Currently, both mental health and obstetric and gynaecological services independently use artificial intelligence applications. Thus, suitable solutions are shared between mental health and obstetric and gynaecological clinical practices, independent of one another. Although, to address complexities with some patients who may have often interchanging sequelae with mental health and obstetric and gynaecological illnesses, 'holistically' developed artificial intelligence applications could be useful. Therefore, we present a rapid review to understand the currently available artificial intelligence applications and research into multi-morbid conditions, including clinical trial-based validations. Most artificial intelligence applications are intrinsically data-driven tools, and their validation in healthcare can be challenging as they require large-scale clinical trials. Furthermore, most artificial intelligence applications use rate-limiting mock data sets, which restrict their applicability to a clinical population. Some researchers may fail to recognize the randomness in the data generating processes in clinical care from a statistical perspective with a potentially minimal representation of a population, limiting their applicability within a real-world setting. However, novel, innovative trial designs could pave the way to generate better data sets that are generalizable to the entire global population. A collaboration between artificial intelligence and statistical models could be developed and deployed with algorithmic and domain interpretability to achieve this. In addition, acquiring big data sets is vital to ensure these artificial intelligence applications provide the highest accuracy within a real-world setting, especially when used as part of a clinical diagnosis or treatment.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33990172/,1,1,United Kingdom,4,2021,4,0,-,"

In this study, we aimed to (1) assess whether the performance of a deep learning algorithm designed to detect low left ventricular ejection fraction using the 12-lead ECG varies by race/ethnicity and to (2) determine whether its performance is determined by the derivation population or by racial variation in the ECG.,We performed a retrospective cohort analysis that included 97 829 patients with paired ECGs and echocardiograms. We tested the model performance by race/ethnicity for convolutional neural network designed to identify patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction ‚â§35% from the 12-lead ECG.,The convolutional neural network that was previously derived in a homogeneous population (derivation cohort, n=44 959; 96.2% non-Hispanic white) demonstrated consistent performance to detect low left ventricular ejection fraction across a range of racial/ethnic subgroups in a separate testing cohort (n=52 870): non-Hispanic white (n=44 524; area under the curve [AUC], 0.931), Asian (n=557; AUC, 0.961), black/African American (n=651; AUC, 0.937), Hispanic/Latino (n=331; AUC, 0.937), and American Indian/Native Alaskan (n=223; AUC, 0.938). In secondary analyses, a separate neural network was able to discern racial subgroup category (black/African American [AUC, 0.84], and white, non-Hispanic [AUC, 0.76] in a 5-class classifier), and a network trained only in non-Hispanic whites from the original derivation cohort performed similarly well across a range of racial/ethnic subgroups in the testing cohort with an AUC of at least 0.930 in all racial/ethnic subgroups.,Our study demonstrates that while ECG characteristics vary by race, this did not impact the ability of a convolutional neural network to predict low left ventricular ejection fraction from the ECG.

Examining recently aggregated data from the Global Symposia on Health Systems Research, a key global fora for HPSR convened by the largest international society-Health Systems Global (HSG)-provides opportunities to enhance existing research on HPSR capacity using novel analytical techniques. This addresses the demand not only to map the field but also to examine potential predictors of acceptance to, and participation at, these global conferences to inform future work and strategies in promoting HPSR. We examined data from the abstracts submitted for two Global Symposia on Health Systems Research in 2016 and 2018 by type of institution, countries, regional groupings and gender. After mapping hotspot areas for HPSR production, we then examined how the corresponding author's characteristics were associated with being accepted to present at the Global Symposia. Our findings showed that submissions for the Global Symposia increased by 12% from 2016 to 2018. Submissions increased across all participant groups, in particular, the for-profit organizations and research/consultancy firms showing the highest increases, at 58% for both. We also found reduced submissions from high-income countries, whereas submissions from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, increased substantially revealing the inclusivity values of Symposium organizers. Submissions increased to a larger extent among women than men. Being a woman, coming from a high-income country and having multiple abstracts submitted were found to be significant predictors for an abstract to be accepted and presented in the Symposia. Findings provide critical baseline information on the extent of interest and engagement in a global forum of various institutions and researchers in HPSR that can be useful for setting future directions of HSG and other similar organizations to support the advancement of HPSR worldwide.",,https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-abstract/34/10/721/5573246,1,1,USA,4,2019,4,0,-,Health Policy and Planning,health inequalities,0,white,Philippines,2,"Harvard Global Health Institute, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Cambridge,",PhD,0,1,white,Switzerland,4,"Curatio International Foundation, 3, 0179 Lado Kavsadze ",PhD,0,,"Philippines, USA, Switzerland","2,4, 4",3,3,3,1,1,"Harvard Global Health Institute, Harvard, University of the Philippines Open, Los Baños, Laguna , Health Systems Global, Morgenstrasse 129, Bern 3018, Switzerland., London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 15-17 Tavistock Place, London ","PhD, PhD, PhD",0,Colombia,6,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Philippines,USA,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, 'white",3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,100%,

Introduction: Because an explicit goal of AI is to perform processes previously reserved for human clinicians and other health care personnel, there is justified concern about the impact on patient safety, efficacy, equity, and liability. Discussion: Systems for computer-assisted and fully automated detection, triage, and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal images show great variation in design, level of autonomy, and intended use. Moreover, the degree to which these systems have been evaluated and validated is heterogeneous. We use the term DR AI system as a general term for any system that interprets retinal images with at least some degree of autonomy from a human grader. We put forth these standardized descriptors to form a means to categorize systems for computer-assisted and fully automated detection, triage, and diagnosis of DR. The components of the categorization system include level of device autonomy, intended use, level of evidence for diagnostic accuracy, and system design. Conclusion: There is currently minimal empirical basis to assert that certain combinations of autonomy, accuracy, or intended use are better or more appropriate than any other. Therefore, at the current stage of development of this document, we have been descriptive rather than prescriptive, and we treat the different categorizations as independent and organized along multiple axes.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32209008/,1,1,USA,4,2020,8,1,Research to Prevent Blindness,Telemedicine and e-Health,"race,  health conditions",1,white,the Netherlands,4,"University of Iowa, Iowa City",PhD,0,1,asian,China,3,"Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, ",MD,0,,"Netherlands, USA, Singapore, USA, USA, USA, China","4, 3, 4, 4, 4,4, 4",7,7,7,1,1,"University of Iowa, Iowa City,  Stanford University School of Medicine, Singapore National Eye Center,  IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, Massachusetts.,  University, Portland, Oregon., University of Vermont Medical Center, Phoenix Indian Medical Center","PhD, MD, PhD, PhD, MD,MD,MD",0,Comoros,0,7,7,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,the Netherlands,USA,Singapore,USA,USA,USA,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, asian, asian, asian, white, white, asian",3,0,0,4,0,7,7,0,43%,

Viewers in these cases are asking themselves ""do those portrayed as at risk look like me?"" An accurate perception of risk is critical for high-risk populations, who already suffer from a range of health disparities. Yet, to date no study has evaluated the demographic representation of health-related content from social media. The objective of this case study was to apply automated image recognition software to examine the demographic profile of faces in Instagram posts containing the hashtag #HIV (obtained from January 2017 through July 2018) and compare this to the demographic breakdown of those most at risk of a new HIV diagnosis (estimates of incidence of new HIV diagnoses from the 2017 US Centers for Disease Control HIV Surveillance Report). We discovered 26,766 Instagram posts containing #HIV authored in American English with 10,036 (37.5%) containing a detectable human face with a total of 18,227 faces (mean = 1.8, standard deviation [SD] = 1.7). Faces skewed older (47% vs. 11% were 35-39 years old), more female (41% vs. 19%), more white (43% vs. 26%), less black (31% vs 44%), and less Hispanic (13% vs 25%) on Instagram than for new HIV diagnoses. The results were similarly skewed among the subset of #HIV posts mentioning pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This disparity might lead Instagram users to potentially misjudge their own HIV risk and delay prophylactic behaviors. Social media managers and organic advocates should be encouraged to share images that better reflect at-risk populations so as not to further marginalize these populations and to reduce disparity in risk perception. Replication of our methods for additional diseases, such as cancer, is warranted to discover and address other misrepresentations.","Adolescent , Adult, Age Factors,  Aged,  Communication,  Ethnicity,  Female,  HIV / physiology,  HIV Infections / transmission*,  Health Promotion / methods

In recent decades, this has prompted a substantial increase in biomedical research efforts outside traditional clinical trial settings. Despite the apparent enthusiasm of researchers, funders, and the media, evidence is scarce for successful implementation of products, algorithms, and services arising that make a real difference to clinical care. This article collection provides concrete examples of how ""big data"" can be used to advance healthcare and discusses some of the limitations and challenges encountered with this type of research. It primarily focuses on real-world data, such as electronic medical records and genomic medicine, considers new developments in AI and digital health, and discusses ethical considerations and issues related to data sharing.

Bias was assessed via testing for differences in type II error rates across racial/ethnic subgroups (Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White, Other) using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. A local surrogate model was estimated to interpret the classifier's predictions by race and averaged globally from the datasets. Subgroup analyses and post-hoc recalibrations were conducted to attempt to mitigate biased metrics.,We identified bias in the false negative rate (FNR = 0.32) of the Black subgroup compared to the FNR (0.17) of the White subgroup. Top features included ""heroin"" and ""substance abuse"" across subgroups. Post-hoc recalibrations eliminated bias in FNR with minimal changes in other subgroup error metrics. The Black FNR subgroup had higher risk scores for readmission and mortality than the White FNR subgroup, and a higher mortality risk score than the Black true positive subgroup (P < .05).,The Black FNR subgroup had the greatest severity of disease and risk for poor outcomes. Similar features were present between subgroups for predicting opioid misuse, but inequities were present.

For the Turkey case, we also developed a model by implementing the multilayer perceptron algorithm for predicting numbers of cases based on the mobility data. We finally created scenarios based on the descriptive statistics of the mobility data of these countries and generated predictions on the numbers of cases by using the developed model. Based on the descriptive analysis, we pointed out that while Poland and Turkey had relatively closer values and distributions on the study variables, South Korea had more stable data compared to Poland and Turkey. We mainly showed that while the stringency index of the current day was associated with mobility data of the same day, the current day's mobility was associated with the numbers of cases 1 month later. By obtaining 89.3% prediction accuracy, we also concluded that the use of mobility data and implementation of big data analytics technique may enable decision-making in managing uncertain environments created by outbreak situations.

Here, we examine the extent to which state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers trained to yield diagnostic labels from X-ray images are biased with respect to protected attributes. We train convolution neural networks to predict 14 diagnostic labels in 3 prominent public chest X-ray datasets: MIMIC-CXR, Chest-Xray8, CheXpert, as well as a multi-site aggregation of all those datasets. We evaluate the TPR disparity - the difference in true positive rates (TPR) - among different protected attributes such as patient sex, age, race, and insurance type as a proxy for socioeconomic status. We demonstrate that TPR disparities exist in the state-of-the-art classifiers in all datasets, for all clinical tasks, and all subgroups. A multi-source dataset corresponds to the smallest disparities, suggesting one way to reduce bias. We find that TPR disparities are not significantly correlated with a subgroup's proportional disease burden. As clinical models move from papers to products, we encourage clinical decision makers to carefully audit for algorithmic disparities prior to deployment.

Methods: 388 people with HIV (PWH) with an average age of 46 (15.8) and median plasma CD4+ T-cell count of 555 copies/mL (79% virally suppressed) underwent cognitive testing and 3T neuroimaging. Demographics, HIV disease variables, and health comorbidities were recorded within three months of cognitive testing/neuroimaging. Hierarchical clustering was employed to identify cognitive phenotypes followed by ensemble machine learning to delineate the features that determined membership in the cognitive phenotypes. Hierarchical clustering identified five cognitive phenotypes. Cluster 1 (n=97) was comprised of individuals with normative performance on all cognitive tests. The remaining clusters were defined by impairment on action fluency (Cluster 2; n=46); verbal learning/memory (Cluster 3; n=73); action fluency and verbal learning/memory (Cluster 4; n=56); and action fluency, verbal learning/memory, and tests of executive function (Cluster 5; n=114). HIV detectability was most common in Cluster 5. Machine learning revealed that polysubstance use, race, educational attainment, and volumes of the precuneus, cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus differentiated membership in the normal vs. impaired clusters. The determinants of persistent cognitive impairment among PWH receiving suppressive treatment are multifactorial nature. Viral replication after ART plays a role in the causal pathway, but psychosocial factors (race inequities, substance use) merit increased attention as critical determinants of cognitive impairment in the context of ART. Results underscore the need for comprehensive person-centered interventions that go beyond adherence to patient care to achieve optimal cognitive health among PWH.",,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11481-021-10045-0,1,1,,,2022,1,1,NIH,Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology,"privacy, consent, race",1,white,USA,4,University of Missouri,PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,Washington University,MD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",12,12,12,1,1,"University of Missouri, University of Missouri, University of Missouri, University of Miami, Rush University, University of Missouri, Washington University, Washington University, University of Missouri, Harvard, Northern Arizona University, Washington University","PhD, MD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, BA, PhD, MS, MD ","0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0",Djibouti,0,12,12,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, asian, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white",11,0,0,1,0,12,12,0,92%,

Machine learning-based population estimates are an attractive option but have not been validated for use in epidemiologic studies. Treating 2010 decennial census counts as a ""ground truth"", we conduct a case study to compare the performance of alternative small-area population denominator estimates from surrounding years for modeling real-time disease incidence rates. Our case study focuses on modeling health disparities in census tract incidence rates in Massachusetts, using population size estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), the most commonly-used intercensal small-area population data in epidemiology, and WorldPop, a machine learning model for high-resolution population size estimation. Through simulation studies and an analysis of real premature mortality data, we evaluate whether WorldPop denominators can provide improved performance relative to ACS for quantifying disparities using both census tract-aggregate and race-stratified modeling approaches. We find that biases induced in parameter estimates due to temporally incompatible incidence and denominator data tend to be larger for race-stratified models than for area-aggregate models. In most scenarios considered here, WorldPop denominators lead to greater bias in estimates of health disparities than ACS denominators. These insights will assist researchers in intercensal years to select appropriate population size estimates for modeling disparities in real-time disease incidence.

Yet, claims to fairness in ML discourses are often vague and contradictory. The response to these issues within the scientific community has been technocratic. Studies either measure (mathematically) competing definitions of fairness, and/or recommend a range of governance tools (eg, fairness checklists or guiding principles). To advance efforts to operationalise fairness in medicine, we synthesised a broad range of literature.,We conducted an environmental scan of English language literature on fairness from 1960-July 31, 2021. Electronic databases Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched, supplemented by additional hand searches. Data from 213 selected publications were analysed using rapid framework analysis. Search and analysis were completed in two rounds: to explore previously identified issues (a priori), as well as those emerging from the analysis (de novo).,Our synthesis identified 'Three Pillars for Fairness': transparency, impartiality and inclusion. We draw on these insights to propose a multidimensional conceptual framework to guide empirical research on the operationalisation of fairness in healthcare.,We apply the conceptual framework generated by our synthesis to risk assessment in psychiatry as a case study. We argue that any claim to fairness must reflect critical assessment and ongoing social and political deliberation around these three pillars with a range of stakeholders, including patients.,We conclude by outlining areas for further research that would bolster ongoing commitments to fairness and health equity in healthcare.",,https://informatics.bmj.com/content/29/1/e100459,1,0,,,2021,1,1,Dalla Lana School of Public Health,BMJ Health & Care Informatics,Risk assessment,0,white,USA,4,University of Toronto,PhD,0,1,white,Canada,4,University of Toronto,PhD,0,,"Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",6,6,6,1,1,"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health","PhD, PhD, MD, MS, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0",Dominican Republic,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, asian, white, white, white",5,0,0,1,0,6,6,0,83%,

This democratization of healthcare is the greatest moral promise of MAI. Whatever comes of the enthusiastic discourse about the ability of MAI to improve the state-of-the-art in high-income countries (HICs), it will be far less impactful than improving the desperate state-of-the-actual in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the almost exclusive development of MAI in HICs risks this promise being thwarted by contextual bias, an algorithmic bias that arises when the context of the training data is significantly dissimilar from potential contexts of application, which makes the unreflective application of HIC-based MAI in LMIC contexts dangerous. The use of MAI in LMICs demands careful attention to context. In this paper, I aim to provide that attention. First, I illustrate the dire state of healthcare in LMICs and the hope that MAI may help us to improve this state.

Then, I explore ethical challenges raised by this risk, and propose policies that will help to overcome those challenges.

We evaluated the feasibility of unsupervised machine learning (ML)-based phenomapping in identifying subgroups of county-level social and demographic risk factors with differential CVD outcomes.,We performed a cross-sectional study using county-level data from 2008 to 2018 from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) WONDER platform and the 2020 Robert Wood Johnson County Health Rankings program. Unsupervised clustering was performed on 46 facets of population characteristics spanning the demographic, health behaviors, socioeconomic, and healthcare access domains. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed using the Moran's I test, and temporal trends in age-adjusted CVD outcomes were evaluated using linear mixed effect models and least square means.,Among 2676 counties, 4 county-level phenogroups were identified (Moran's I p-value <0.001). Phenogroup 1 (N ‚Äã= ‚Äã924; 24.5%) counties were largely white, suburban households with high income and access to healthcare. Phenogroup 2 counties (N ‚Äã= ‚Äã451; 16.9%) included predominantly Hispanic residents and below-average prevalence of CVD risk factors. Phenogroup 3 (N ‚Äã= ‚Äã951; 35.5%) counties included rural, white residents with the lowest levels of access to healthcare. Phenogroup 4 (350; 13.1%) comprised counties with predominantly Black residents, substantial cardiovascular comorbidities, and physical and socioeconomic burdens. Least square means in age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality over time increased in a stepwise fashion from 223 in phenogroup 1 to 317 per 100,000 residents in phenogroup 4.,Unsupervised ML-based clustering on county-level population characteristics can identify unique phenogroups with differential risk of CVD mortality. Phenogroup identification may aid in developing a uniform set of preventive initiatives for clustered counties to address regional differences in CVD mortality.",Cardiovascular disease; Epidemiology; Machine learning; Risk factors.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34327478/,1,1,USA,4,2020,1,1,"Amgen, AstraZeneca, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Esperion Therapeutics, Amarin, Sanofi, Regeneron, Novo Nordisk, Novartis, The Medicines Company, New Amsterdam, Pfizer, Texas Health, ",American Journal of Preventive Cardiology,"race, income",1,white,USA,4,University of Texas,MD,0,1,asian,USA,4,University of Texas,MD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",10,10,10,1,1,"University of Texas, University of Texas, University of Texas, Johns Hopkins University, Northwestern University, University of Mississippi, University of Mississippi, University of Texas, University of Texas, University of Texas","MD, MD, MD, MD, MD, PhD, PhD, MD, PhD, MD","0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0",Ecuador,0,10,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, asian, white, white, asian, hispanic, black, white, white, asian ",5,1,1,3,0,10,10,0,50%,

Digital medicine is on its way to becoming just plain medicine. But who will digitize how we define health and disease? And who will deploy this knowledge to improve the lives of patients that medicine - and digital medicine - exists to serve? Here we define the emerging field of digital medicine and identify the disciplines and skills needed for success. We examine the current and projected skills gaps. We also consider the impact of the culture clash that occurs at the intersection of healthcare and technology, and the lack of diversity in the workforce of both of these fields. We conclude by describing the requirements for the skills pivot needed to ensure that the digital transformation of healthcare is successful: (1) big tent thinking to recognize the critical importance of new technical skills alongside more traditional clinical disciplines, (2) the integration of clinical and technical skill sets within educational curricula, companies, and professional institutions, and (3) a commitment to diversity that goes beyond lip service.",Digital health; Digital medicine; FDA; Healthcare; Healthcare equity; Med tech; Medical education.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33442586/,1,1,,,2020,9,0,,Digital Biomarkers,"privacy, diversity",0,white,USA,4,Digital Medicine Society,MBA,0,1,white,USA,4,Rocky Vista University,DO,0,,"USA, USA","4, 4",2,2,2,1,1,"Digital Medicine Society, Rocky Vista University","MBA, DO","0, 0",Egypt,3,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white",2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,100%,

The model was then validated on two cohorts of patients with COVID-19: 814 ambulatory patients from a suburban location (presenting from March 14, 2020, to October 24, 2020, the internal ambulatory cohort) and 485 hospitalized patients from an inner-city location (hospitalized from March 14, 2020, to August 12, 2020, the external hospitalized cohort). The CNN model predictions were validated against electronic health record administrative codes in both cohorts and assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CXRs from the ambulatory cohort were also reviewed by two board-certified radiologists and compared with the CNN-predicted values for the same cohort to produce a receiver operating characteristic curve and the AUC. The atherosclerosis diagnosis discrepancy, Œîvasc, referring to the difference between the predicted value and presence or absence of the vascular disease HCC categorical code, was calculated. Linear regression was performed to determine the association of Œîvasc with the covariates of age, sex, race/ethnicity, language preference, and social deprivation index. Logistic regression was used to look for an association between the presence of any hierarchical condition category codes with Œîvasc and other covariates.,The CNN prediction for vascular disease from frontal CXRs in the ambulatory cohort had an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.89) and in the hospitalized cohort had an AUC of 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.75) against the electronic health record data. In the ambulatory cohort, the consensus radiologists' reading had an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.92) relative to the CNN. Multivariate linear regression of Œîvasc in the ambulatory cohort demonstrated significant negative associations with non-English-language preference (Œ≤ = -0.083, P < .05) and Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (Œ≤ = -0.048, P < .05) and positive associations with age (Œ≤ = 0.005, P < .001) and sex (Œ≤ = 0.044, P < .05). For the hospitalized cohort, age was also significant (Œ≤ = 0.003, P < .01), as was social deprivation index (Œ≤ = 0.002, P < .05). The Œîvasc variable (odds ratio [OR], 0.34), Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (OR, 1.58), non-English-language preference (OR, 1.74), and site (OR, 0.22) were independent predictors of having one or more hierarchical condition category codes (P < .01 for all) in the combined patient cohort.,A CNN model was predictive of aortic atherosclerosis in two cohorts (one ambulatory and one hospitalized) with COVID-19. The discrepancy between the CNN model and the administrative code, Œîvasc, was associated with language preference in the ambulatory cohort; in the hospitalized cohort, this discrepancy was associated with social deprivation index. The absence of administrative code(s) was associated with Œîvasc in the combined cohorts, suggesting that Œîvasc is an independent predictor of health disparities. This may suggest that biomarkers extracted from routine imaging studies and compared with electronic health record data could play a role in enhancing value-based health care for traditionally underserved or disadvantaged patients for whom barriers to care exist.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35033309/,1,1,USA,4,2022,2,1,University of Illinois at Chicago Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS),Journal of the American College of Radiology,"race, socioeconomic disparities",0,white,USA,4,Duly Health and Care,MD,0,1,White,USA,4,University of Illinois at Chicago,"MD, PhD",1,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",10,10,10,1,1,Duly Health and Care; University of Illinois at Chicago; University of Central Florida; Emory University; Northwestern University; Anthem Inc; Duly Health and Care; Northwestern University; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois at Chicago,"MD, MD, MD, MD, MD, MS, MD, PhD, PhD, MD/PhD","0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1",Equatorial Guinea,0,10,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, hispanic, white, white, white, white, asian, white, white, white",8,0,1,1,0,10,10,0,80%,

Even the definitions of these 2 words are not universally agreed upon, and they are often used interchangeably.5,6 However, the distinction is important to inform the solutions clinical leaders and policymakers might put into place.
 
 The major barrier to understand the proportion of variation that is because of different biology versus variation that is because of disparate treatment or differential response to treatment, particularly in complex real-world settings, is that we rarely have the opportunity to concurrently examine data that might elucidate each. However, our growing ability to leverage big data through novel analytics may begin to change that in meaningful ways.

However, no trials of statin utilization with clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) end points have been completed in PWH, and there are sparse real-world data regarding statin use and lipid-lowering effectiveness. We therefore used a unique cohort of PWH and uninfected controls to evaluate (1) differences in statin types used for PWH versus uninfected persons; (2) lipid lowering achieved by statin use for PWH versus uninfected persons; and (3) racial and ethnic disparities in appropriate statin use among PWH and uninfected persons.,We analyzed a cohort of 5,039 PWH and 10,011 uninfected demographically matched controls who received care at a large urban medical center between January 1, 2000, and May 17, 2017. Medication administration records, prescription data, and validated natural language processing algorithms were used to determine statin utilization. Statins were categorized by generic active ingredient name and intensity (high, moderate, or low). Lipid values collected in routine clinical care were available for analysis. The first set of analyses was restricted to PWH and uninfected matched controls taking statins and compared (1) differences in statin type and (2) difference in cholesterol levels after versus before statin initiation by HIV status. For the second set of analyses, we first used prevalent CVD risk factors to determine participants with statin indications and then determined how many of these participants were taking statins. We then compared statin utilization among persons with indications for statins by race/ethnic group for PWH and uninfected matched controls using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression.,Among people prescribed statins, PWH were more likely than controls to have ever taken pravastatin (34.8% vs 12.3%, P < .001) or atorvastatin (72.2% vs 65.6%, P = .002) and less likely to have ever taken simvastatin (14.2% vs 39.5%, P < .001). Among PWH with indications for statin utilization, 55.7% of whites, 39.4% of blacks, and 45.8% of Hispanics were prescribed statins (P < .001). These differences in statin prescription by race/ethnicity remained significant after adjustment for demographics (including insurance status), cardiovascular risk factors, antiretroviral therapy use, HIV viremia, and CD4 count. These racial/ethnic disparities in statin utilization were less pronounced among uninfected persons.,Among PWH with statin indication(s), blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to have been prescribed a statin. These racial/ethnic disparities were less pronounced among uninfected persons. There were significant differences in type of statin used for PWH compared to uninfected matched controls. Future efforts addressing disparities in CVD prevention among PWH are warranted.","Adult Aged Biomarkers / blood Cardiovascular Diseases / ethnology, Cardiovascular Diseases / etiology, Cardiovascular Diseases / prevention & control*, Ethnicity*, Female, Follow-Up Studies, HIV Infections / blood, HIV Infections / complications*, HIV Infections / ethnology, HIV*, Humans, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors / therapeutic use*, Lipids / blood*, Male, Middle Aged,Racial Groups*,Retrospective Studies,United States / epidemiology","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30685678/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Among%20PWH%20with%20statin,compared%20to%20uninfected%20matched%20controls.",1,1,USA,4,2019,14,1,American Heart Association,American Heart Journal,"race, health conditions",1,white,USA,4,Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,BS,0,1,White,USA,4,Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,"MD, MSc",0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4,,4,4,4,4,4,4",13,13,13,1,1,Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse; Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse; University of Texas – Southwestern Medical Center; Vanderbilt University; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,"BS, BA, BS, MBA, MS, MD, MD, MBBS, MD/MPH, MD, MD, MD/ScM, MD/MSc","0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",Estonia,0,13,13,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",13,0,0,0,0,13,13,0,100%,

Digital health encompasses electronic health, computing science, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, to name but a few technical components. Digital health is part of a vision for systems medicine. The advances in digital health have been, however, uneven and highly variable across communities, countries, medical specialties, and societal contexts. This article critically examines the determinants of digital health (DDH). DDH describes and critically responds to inequities and differences in digital health theory and practice across people, places, spaces, and time. DDH is not limited to studying variability in design and access to digital technologies. DDH is situated within a larger context of the political determinants of health. Hence, this article presents an analysis of DDH, as seen through political science, and the feminist studies of technology and society. A feminist lens would strengthen systems-driven, historically and critically informed governance for DDH. This would be a timely antidote against unchecked destructive/extractive governance narratives (e.g., technocracy and patriarchy) that produce and reproduce the health inequities. Moreover, feminist framing of DDH can help cultivate epistemic competence to detect and reject false equivalences in how we understand the emerging digital world(s). False equivalence, very common in the current pandemic and post-truth era, is a type of flawed reasoning in decision-making where equal weight is given to arguments with concrete material evidence, and those that are conjecture, untrue, or unjust. A feminist conceptual lens on DDH would help remedy what I refer to in this article as ""the normative deficits"" in science and technology policy that became endemic with the rise of neoliberal governance since the 1980s in particular. In this context, it is helpful to recall the feminist writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Le Guin posed ""what if?"" questions, to break free from oppressive narratives such as patriarchy and re-imagine technology futures. It is time to envision an emancipated, equitable, and more democratic world by asking ""what if we lived in a feminist world?"" That would be truly awesome, for everyone, women and men, children, youth, and future generations, to steer digital technologies and the new field of DDH toward broadly relevant, ethical, experiential, democratic, and socially responsive health outcomes.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33794130/,1,0,Global,?,2021,8,0,-,OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology,"gender, political sciences",1,white,USA,4,OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology,"MD, PhD",0,1,White,USA,4,OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology,"MD, PhD",0,,USA,4,1,1,1,1,1,OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology,MD/PhD,0,Finland,3,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['white'],1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,100%,

However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation. There is a complex range of issues with effectiveness, equity, access, and ethics (eg, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability), which warrant resolution. Evidence-informed policies, development of eminent digital products and services, and skills to use and maintain these solutions are required. Studies need to focus on developing digital platforms with explainable artificial intelligence-based apps to enhance resilience and guide the treatment decisions of mental health practitioners. Investments in digital mental health should ensure their safety and workability. End users should encourage the use of innovative methods to encourage developers to effectively evaluate their products and services and to render them a worthwhile investment. Technology-enabled services in a hybrid model of care are most likely to be effective (eg, specialists using these services among vulnerable, at-risk populations but not severe cases of mental ill health).",COVID-19; challenges; digital mental health implementation; explainable artificial intelligence; human-computer interaction; hybrid model of care; resilience; technology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33779570/,1,0,Australia,4,2021,17,0,-,JMIR Mental Health,mental illness,1,white,Australia,4,Griffith University,PhD,0,1,white,Italy,4,Griffith University,"MD, PhD",0,,"Australia, Italy","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,Griffith University; Griffith University,"PhD, MD/PhD",0,France,30,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Australia,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white']",2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,100%,

These are considered in relation to not only digital technology and infrastructure, but also wider aspects of health systems, the nature of primary care work and culture, patient characteristics and inequalities, and ethical issues around data privacy, inclusion, empowerment, empathy and trust. Implications for the future direction and sustainability of these approaches are discussed, taking account of novel paradigms, such as artificial intelligence, and the growing capture of primary care data for secondary uses. Decision makers are encouraged to think holistically about where value is most likely to be added, or risks being taken away, when judging which innovations to carry forward.

PEP was used to gather and analyse all comments from NHS UK, Google, Facebook and Twitter that related to care experiences of people who identified as living with overweight or obesity across all NHS Acute and Specialist Trusts and all general practitioners (GPs) in England from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2020. These healthcare experiences were analysed to provide care quality metrics, a comparison of care across regions of England, and to explore associations between behavioural clusters of personality attributes, values and sentiment with care quality metrics.,Perceptions of the quality of care were significantly lower for people who identified as living with overweight or obesity compared to people who didn't identify as living with overweight or obesity across all regions for 'Effective Treatment' and 'Emotional Support'. The perceived quality of care metrics can be predicted by the behavioral clusters, where for instance, the experiences of people who identified as living with overweight or obesity in the negative behavioral cluster have a lower overall perceived quality of care score. Themes arising from the data also highlighted that barriers quality care experienced by people who identified as living with obesity include the speed of access, effective treatment, and emotional support, with stigmatising healthcare experiences are reported.,The findings of this study provide insights into the experiences reported via freely available websites, of people who self-identified as living with overweight or obesity in healthcare in England. These insights demonstrate that the perceived quality of care was lower for people who identified as living with overweight or obesity compared to the general population, and that there is regional variation in care quality. The study has also shown that patient experiences differ based on personality attributes, values and sentiment, highlighting the need for patient-centred care and personalised approaches.

The objective of this study is to quantify the association between climate, demographic and socio-economic factors on digital reporting of disease at the US county level. We reference approximately 1.5 million foodservice business reviews between 2004 and 2014, and use census data, machine learning methods and regression models to assess whether digital reporting of disease is associated with climate, socio-economic and demographic factors. The results show that reviews of foodservice businesses and digital reports of foodborne illness follow a clear seasonal pattern with higher reporting observed in the summer, when most foodborne outbreaks are reported and to a lesser extent in the winter months. Additionally, factors typically associated with affluence (such as, higher median income and fraction of the population with a bachelor's degrees) were positively correlated with foodborne illness reports. However, restaurants per capita and education were the most significant predictors of illness reporting at the US county level. These results suggest that well-known health disparities might also be reflected in the online environment.

A 2 √ó 2 factorial design for the gender and race of simulated physicians was conducted between March 9 and July 25, 2018. Participants were excluded before intervention if they were younger than 18 years, were pregnant, or had a history of cancer or abdominal surgical procedures.,A clinical vignette was presented to the participant with a picture of the emergency department physician. Participants were randomly assigned to physicians with different gender and race, with 823 assigned to black women, 791 to black men, 828 to white women, and 835 to white men. A contradictory diagnosis from an online symptom checker introduced doubt about the clinical diagnosis.,A composite outcome (range, 0-100, with 0 representing low patient confidence and satisfaction and 100 representing the maximum on the composite scale) measured participant (1) confidence in the physician, (2) satisfaction with care, (3) likelihood to recommend the physician, (4) trust in the physician's diagnosis, and (5) likelihood to request additional tests.,Among 3277 adult participants, complete data were available for 3215 (median age, 49 years [range, 18-89 years]; 1667 [52%] female; 2433 [76%] white).

Here we outline key challenges to biomedical AI in outcome design, data collection and technology evaluation, and use examples from precision health to illustrate how bias and health disparity may arise in each stage.

Recent developments in artificial neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning have ignited debate with respect to ethical and legal challenges associated with the use of AI in healthcare and medicine. While AI in nuclear medicine has the potential to improve workflow and productivity, and enhance clinical and research capabilities, there remains a professional responsibility to the profession and to patients: ethical, social, and legal. Enthusiasm to embrace new technology should not displace responsibilities for the ethical, social, and legal application of technology. This is especially true in relation to data usage, the algorithms applied, and how algorithms are used in practice. Governance of software and algorithms used for detection (segmentation) and/or diagnosis (classification) of disease using medical images requires rigorous evidence-based regulation. A number of frameworks have been developed for ethical application of AI generally in society and in radiology. For nuclear medicine, consideration needs to be given to beneficence, nonmaleficence, fairness and justice, safety, reliability, data security, privacy and confidentiality, mitigation of bias, transparency, explainability, and autonomy. AI is merely a tool, how it is utilised is a human choice. There is potential for AI applications to enhance clinical and research practice in nuclear medicine and concurrently produce deeper, more meaningful interactions between the physicians and the patient.

It should not be left to AI developers, being research institutions or global tech companies, to decide how to resolve these ethical questions. Particularly, relying only on the trustworthiness of companies and institutions to address ethical issues relating to justice, fairness and health equality would be unsuitable and unwise.

This is driven by promising results reported in many research papers, the increasing number of AI-based software products, and by the general interest in Artificial Intelligence to solve complex problems. It is therefore of importance to improve the quality of machine learning output and add safeguards to support their adoption. In addition to regulatory and logistical strategies, a crucial aspect is to detect when a Machine Learning model is not able to generalize to new unseen instances, which may originate from a population distant to that of the training population or from an under-represented subpopulation. As a result, the prediction of the machine learning model for these instances may be often wrong, given that the model is applied outside its ""reliable"" space of work, leading to a decreasing trust of the final users, such as clinicians. For this reason, when a model is deployed in practice, it would be important to advise users when the model's predictions may be unreliable, especially in high-stakes applications, including those in healthcare. Yet, reliability assessment of each machine learning prediction is still poorly addressed. Here, we review approaches that can support the identification of unreliable predictions, we harmonize the notation and terminology of relevant concepts, and we highlight and extend possible interrelationships and overlap among concepts. We then demonstrate, on simulated and real data for ICU in-hospital death prediction, a possible integrative framework for the identification of reliable and unreliable predictions. To do so, our proposed approach implements two complementary principles, namely the density principle and the local fit principle. The density principle verifies that the instance we want to evaluate is similar to the training set. The local fit principle verifies that the trained model performs well on training subsets that are more similar to the instance under evaluation. Our work can contribute to consolidating work in machine learning especially in medicine.",Machine learning trustworthinessPredictive reliabilityUncertainty,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046422000120,1,1,-,-,2022,2,1,"Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering of University of Pavia and by the European Commission as part of the PERISCOPE project",Journal of Biomedical Informatics,Machine learning trustworthinessPredictive reliabilityUncertainty,0,white,Italy,4,University of Pavia,PhD,0,1,white,Italy,4,"University of Pavia,",PhD,0,,"Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Italy","1,4,4,4",4,4,4,1,1,"University of Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam","PhD, PHD,",0,Hong Kong,4,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Mexico,the Netherlands,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'hispanic', 'white', 'white']",3,0,1,0,0,4,4,0,75%,

It is a neglected public health challenge globally, with less attention to its social determinants. We examined spatial patterns of country-level stillbirth rates and determined the influence of social determinants of health on spatial patterns of stillbirth rates. We also estimated probabilistic relationships between stillbirth rates and significant determinants from the spatial analysis. Using country-level aggregated data from the United Nations databases, it employed ecological spatial analysis and artificial intelligence modeling based on Bayesian network among 194 World Health Organization member countries. From the spatial analysis, thirty-seven countries formed a cluster of high values (hot-spots) for stillbirth and 13 countries formed a cluster of low values (cold-spots). In the multivariate regression, gender inequality and anaemia in pregnancy were significantly associated with spatial patterns of higher stillbirth rates, while higher antenatal care (ANC) coverage and skilled birth attendants during delivery were associated with clusters of lower stillbirth rates. The Bayesian network model suggests strong dependencies between stillbirth rate and gender inequality index, geographic regions and skilled birth attendants during delivery. The Bayesian network predicted that the probability of low stillbirth rate increased from 56% to 100% when the percentage of countries with high skilled birth attendants during delivery increased from 70% to 88%, high ANC coverage increased from 55% to 70%, high prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy decreased from 27% to 11% and high gender inequality index decreased from 43% to 21%.

Here, we use nine PM2.5 concentration models (i.e., exposure models) that span a wide range of methods to investigate i) PM2.5 concentrations in 2011, ii) potential changes in PM2.5 concentrations between 2011 and 2028 due to on-the-books regulations, and iii) PM2.5 exposure for the U.S. population and four racial/ethnic groups. The exposure models included two geophysical chemical transport models (CTMs), two interpolation methods, a satellite-derived aerosol optical depth-based method, a Bayesian statistical regression model, and three data-rich machine learning methods. We focused on annual predictions that were regridded to 12-km resolution over the conterminous U.S., but also considered 1-km predictions in sensitivity analyses. The exposure models predicted broadly consistent PM2.5 concentrations, with relatively high concentrations on average over the eastern U.S. and greater variability in the western U.S. However, differences in national concentration distributions (median standard deviation: 1.00 Œºg m-3) and spatial distributions over urban areas were evident. Further exploration of these differences and their implications for specific applications would be valuable. PM2.5 concentrations were estimated to decrease by about 1 Œºg m-3 on average due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028, with decreases of more than 3 Œºg m-3 in areas with relatively high 2011 concentrations that were projected to experience relatively large emission reductions. Agreement among models was closer for population-weighted than uniformly weighted averages across the domain. About 50% of the population was estimated to experience PM2.5 concentrations less than 10 Œºg m-3 in 2011 and PM2.5 improvements of about 2 Œºg m-3 due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028.

Development and health indicators assessed at national or subnational scale can often conceal important inequities, with the rural poor often least well represented. The ability to target limited resources is fundamental, especially in an international context where funding for health and development comes under pressure. This has recently prompted the exploration of the potential of spatial interpolation methods based on geolocated clusters from national household survey data for the high-resolution mapping of features such as population age structures, vaccination coverage and access to sanitation. It remains unclear, however, how predictable these different factors are across different settings, variables and between demographic groups. Here we test the accuracy of spatial interpolation methods in producing gender-disaggregated high-resolution maps of the rates of literacy, stunting and the use of modern contraceptive methods from a combination of geolocated demographic and health surveys cluster data and geospatial covariates. Bayesian geostatistical and machine learning modelling methods were tested across four low-income countries and varying gridded environmental and socio-economic covariate datasets to build 1√ó1 km spatial resolution maps with uncertainty estimates. Results show the potential of the approach in producing high-resolution maps of key gender-disaggregated socio-economic indicators, with explained variance through cross-validation being as high as 74-75% for female literacy in Nigeria and Kenya, and in the 50-70% range for many other variables. However, substantial variations by both country and variable were seen, with many variables showing poor mapping accuracies in the range of 2-30% explained variance using both geostatistical and machine learning approaches. The analyses offer a robust basis for the construction of timely maps with levels of detail that support geographically stratified decision-making and the monitoring of progress towards development goals. However, the great variability in results between countries and variables highlights the challenges in applying these interpolation methods universally across multiple countries, and the importance of validation and quantifying uncertainty if this is undertaken.",,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2016.0825,1,1,"Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, bangladesh","2, 2, 2, 2",2017,57,1,U19 AI089674/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,Journal Royal Society Interface,development indicators; geo-statistics; geographic information system; mapping.,1,white,Italy,4,University of Southampton,PhD,0,1,white,UK,4,University of Southampton,PhD,0,,"Italy, Kenya, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, USA, UK, USA, USA, Sweden, UK","4,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",12,12,12,1,1,"Flowminder Foundation, University of Southampton, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm School of Economics","PhD, BA, PhD, PHD, PhD, PhD, Msc, PhD, PhD, PhD",0,India,84,12,12,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Kenya,UK,Switzerland,Sweden,Italy,USA,UK,USA,USA,Sweden,UK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white', 'black,' 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'asian', 'white', white",10,1,0,1,0,12,12,0,83%,

The model, originally derived and validated in Ontario, Canada, was applied to an external validation cohort. HRUPoRT model predictors included chronic conditions, socio-demographics, and health behavioural risk factors. The cohort consisted of 10,504 adults (‚â•18 years old) from the Canadian Community Health Survey in Manitoba, Canada (cycles 2007/08 and 2009/10). A person-centred costing algorithm was applied to linked health administrative databases to determine respondents' healthcare utilization over 5 years. Model fit was assessed using the c-statistic for discrimination and calibration plots. In the external validation cohort, HRUPoRT demonstrated strong discrimination (c statistic = 0.83) and was well calibrated across the range of risk. HRUPoRT performed well in an external validation cohort, demonstrating transportability of the model in other jurisdictions.

But issues related to biases of these models and the extent to which they treat certain segments of the population unfairly, have led to legitimate concerns. There is agreement that because of biases in the datasets we present to the models, a fairness-oblivious training will lead to unfair models. An interesting topic is the study of mechanisms via which the de novo design or training of the model can be informed by fairness measures. Here, we study strategies to impose fairness concurrently while training the model. While many fairness based approaches in vision rely on training adversarial modules together with the primary classification/regression task, in an effort to remove the influence of the protected attribute or variable, we show how ideas based on well-known optimization concepts can provide a simpler alternative. In our proposal, imposing fairness just requires specifying the protected attribute and utilizing our routine. We provide a detailed technical analysis and present experiments demonstrating that various fairness measures can be reliably imposed on a number of training tasks in vision in a manner that is interpretable.",,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01355,1,1,USA,4,2020,11,1,NIA HHS United States,Comput Vis ECCV,-,1,white,India,2,University of Wisconsin-Madison,PhD,0,1,asian,USA,4,University of Wisconsin-Madison,PhD,0,,"India, USA, India, India","2, 4,2,2",4,4,4,1,1,"University of Wisconsin-Madison,

Monte Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the properties of fold-stratified cross-validation in the case of a model data analysis using both synthetic data and MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III) medical records.,In situations in which duplicated EHRs could induce overoptimistic estimations of accuracy, applying fold-stratified cross-validation prevented this bias, while not requiring full deduplication. However, a pessimistic bias might appear if the covariate used for the stratification was strongly associated with the outcome.,Although fold-stratified cross-validation presents low computational overhead, to be efficient it requires the preliminary identification of a covariate that is both shared by duplicated records and weakly associated with the outcome. When available, the hash of a personal identifier or a patient's date of birth provides such a covariate. On the contrary, pseudonymization interferes with fold-stratified cross-validation, as it may break the equality of the stratifying covariate among duplicates.,Fold-stratified cross-validation is an easy-to-implement methodology that prevents data leakage when a model is trained on distributed EHRs that contain duplicates, while preserving privacy.",,https://www.google.com/search?q=Fold-stratified+cross-validation+for+unbiased+and+privacy-preserving+federated+learning.&rlz=1C5CHFA_enMT1017MT1017&oq=Fold-stratified+cross-validation+for+unbiased+and+privacy-preserving+federated+learning.&aqs=chrome..69i57.289j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,1,1,USA,4,2020,6,1,Bpifrance as part of the HealthChain projec,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,data leakage; duplicated electronic health records; federated learning; privacy; validation.,1,white,France,4,Université de Paris,PhD,0,1,white,France,4,Université de Paris,PhD,0,,"France, France, France, France, France","4,4,4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"Nantes University, Université de Paris, Université de Paris","- , MD, MPH, PhD",0,Ireland,4,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,France,France,France,France,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,100%,

However, this is an especially challenging task given the fragmented state of medical data within Appalachia and the need for integration of other types of data such as environmental, social, and economic with medical data.,This paper aims to present the structure and process of the development of an integrated platform at a midlevel Appalachian academic medical center along with its initial uses.,The Appalachian Informatics Platform was developed by the Appalachian Clinical and Translational Science Institute's Division of Clinical Informatics and consists of 4 major components: a centralized clinical data warehouse, modeling (statistical and machine learning), visualization, and model evaluation.

In particular, gait activity recognition is useful to identify various risk factors in people's health that are directly related to their physical activity. One of the issues in activity recognition, and gait in particular, is that often datasets are unbalanced (i.e., the distribution of classes is not uniform), and due to this disparity, the models tend to categorize into the class with more instances. In the present study, two methods for classifying gait activities using accelerometer and gyroscope data from a large-scale public dataset were evaluated and compared. The gait activities in this dataset are: (i) going down an incline, (ii) going up an incline, (iii) walking on level ground, (iv) going down stairs, and (v) going up stairs. The proposed methods are based on conventional (shallow) and deep learning techniques. In addition, data were evaluated from three data treatments: original unbalanced data, sampled data, and augmented data. The latter was based on the generation of synthetic data according to segmented gait data. The best results were obtained with classifiers built with augmented data, with F-measure results of 0.812 (œÉ = 0.078) for the shallow learning approach, and of 0.927 (œÉ = 0.033) for the deep learning approach.

Digital health and welfare technologies enable remote monitoring and treatments, and artificial intelligence is proposed as a means of prediction instead of reaction to individuals' health and as an enabler of proactive care and rehabilitation. The digital transformation not only affects hospital and primary care but also how the community meets older people's needs. Community care is often provided by informal and formal care-givers, most of whom are women. Gender equality is at the heart of many national strategies, but do all genders have equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities when it comes to community care and its digital transformation? The digital transformation of community care is entangled with how care is provided to older people and the working conditions of community-care professionals. Current and, even more so, future community-care systems are and will be partly constituted by networks of technological artefacts. These health and welfare technological artefacts and the discourse surrounding them mediate and constitute social relations and community care.

There has been little research into whether clozapine prescription, the first-line treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), is affected by patient gender.,This retrospective cohort study identified 2244 patients with TRS within the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, by using a bespoke method validated against a gold-standard, manually coded, dataset of TRS cases. The outcome and exposures were identified from the free-text using natural language processing applications (including machine learning and rules-based approaches) and from information entered in structured fields. Multivariable logistic regression was carried out to calculate the odds ratios for clozapine prescription according to patients' gender, and adjusting for numerous potential confounders including sociodemographic, clinical (e.g., psychiatric comorbidities and substance use), neutropenia, functional factors (e.g., problems with occupation), and clinical monitoring.,Clozapine was prescribed to 77% of the women and 85% of the men with TRS. Women had reduced odds of being prescribed clozapine as compared to men after adjusting for all factors included in the present study (adjusted OR: 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-0.97; p = 0.037).,Women with TRS are less likely to be prescribed clozapine than men with TRS, even when considering the effects of multiple clinical and functional factors.

A convenience sample of 777 physicians and nurses who treat cancer patients in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and Peru were surveyed. Providers were identified through mass mailings, distribution at professional meetings and conferences, collaboration with regional institutions, professional organizations, and PAHO and online posting. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of quality-of-care assessments in each country. The five predictive models were subsequently compared descriptively. Higher access to care ratings and greater availability of end-of-life services corresponded with improved institutional quality-of-care ratings for all five countries. Barring respondents from Cuba, providers from the other four nations who practice in public institutions rated the quality of advanced-cancer care in their own institutions lower than those practicing in private hospitals or specialized cancer centers. Other institutional quality-of-care predictors included type of city, affordability-of-care ratings, availability of opioid analgesics, where patients die, barriers to cancer pain management, and the provider's specialty and gender. These findings highlight the need for providing accessible care and services to improve the quality of advanced-cancer care in Latin American institutions.

With the availability of machine learning tools coupled with vast data sources, the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common chronic disease with significant associated morbidity and socioeconomic impact, is undergoing a knowledge and practice transformation in the increasingly complex healthcare environment. Among other advances, deep-learning machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, have enabled the development of AF screening pathways using the ubiquitous 12-lead ECG to detect asymptomatic paroxysmal AF in at-risk populations (such as those with cryptogenic stroke), the refinement of AF and stroke prediction schemes through comprehensive digital phenotyping using structured and unstructured data abstraction from the electronic health record or wearable monitoring technologies, and the optimization of treatment strategies, ranging from stroke prophylaxis to monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Although the clinical and population-wide impact of these tools continues to be elucidated, such transformative progress does not come without challenges, such as the concerns about adopting black box technologies, assessing input data quality for training such models, and the risk of perpetuating rather than alleviating health disparities.

Values for nearly 4,000 variables reflecting demographics, alcohol and other drug use, general health, non-drug use behaviors, and diagnoses for other psychiatric disorders, were obtained for each participant from the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism, a detailed semi-structured interview.,Support vector machine models performed marginally better on average than other machine learning methods with maximum prediction accuracies of 75.4% in AAs and 79.4% in EAs. Subsequent stepwise regression considered the 83 most highly ranked variables across all methods and models and identified less recent cocaine use (AAs: odds ratio (OR) = 1.82, P = 9.19 √ó 10-5; EAs: OR = 1.91, P = 3.30 √ó 10-15), shorter duration of opioid use (AAs: OR = 0.55, P = 5.78 √ó 10-6; EAs: OR = 0.69, P = 3.01 √ó 10-7), and older age (AAs: OR = 2.44, P = 1.41 √ó 10-12; EAs: OR = 2.00, P = 5.74 √ó 10-9) as the strongest independent predictors of opioid cessation in both AAs and EAs.

Factors related to drug use comprised about half of the significant independent predictors in both AAs and EAs, with other predictors related to non-drug use behaviors, psychiatric disorders, overall health, and demographics.,These proof-of-concept findings provide avenues for hypothesis-driven analysis, and will lead to further research on strategies to improve OUD management in EAs and AAs.",,https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em/Article/10013,1,1,USA,4,2020,1,1,NIH,Explor Med,"Opiod use disorder, machine learning, opioid cessation, feature selection, outcome prediction, African American ",1,white,USA,4,Boston University,PhD,0,0,white,USA,4,Boston University,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",8,8,8,1,1,"Boston University, University of Pennsylvania, Yale, VA CT Healthcare Center ","PhD, PhD,PhD, MD, PhD, MD, MD, PhD",0,Lebanon,0,8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'asian', 'white', 'white', 'white']",7,0,0,1,0,8,8,0,88%,

However, questions remain about how differences in patient characteristics and demographics might influence the likelihood of refill using this channel.,The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an SMS-based refill reminder solution using conversational artificial intelligence (AI; an automated system that mimics human conversations) with a large Medicare patient population and to explore the association and impact of patient demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, language) and social determinants of health on successful engagement with the solution to improve refill adherence.,The study targeted 99,217 patients with chronic disease, median age of 71 years, for medication refill using the mPulse Mobile interactive SMS text messaging solution from December 2016 to February 2019. All patients were partially adherent or nonadherent Medicare Part D members of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, a large integrated health plan. Patients received SMS reminders in English or Spanish and used simple numeric or text responses to validate their identity, view their medication, and complete a refill request. The refill requests were processed by Kaiser Permanente pharmacists and support staff, and refills were picked up at the pharmacy or mailed to patients. Descriptive statistics and predictive analytics were used to examine the patient population and their refill behavior. Qualitative text analysis was used to evaluate quality of conversational AI.,Over the course of the study, 273,356 refill reminders requests were sent to 99,217 patients, resulting in 47,552 refill requests (17.40%). This was consistent with earlier pilot study findings. Of those who requested a refill, 54.81% (26,062/47,552) did so within 2 hours of the reminder. There was a strong inverse relationship (r10=-0.93) between social determinants of health and refill requests. Spanish speakers (5149/48,156, 10.69%) had significantly lower refill request rates compared with English speakers (42,389/225,060, 18.83%; X21 [n=273,216]=1829.2; P<.001). There were also significantly different rates of refill requests by age band (X26 [n=268,793]=1460.3; P<.001), with younger patients requesting refills at a higher rate. Finally, the vast majority (284,598/307,484, 92.23%) of patient responses were handled using conversational AI.,Multiple factors impacted refill request rates, including a strong association between social determinants of health and refill rates. The findings suggest that higher refill requests are linked to language, race/ethnicity, age, and social determinants of health, and that English speakers, whites, those younger than 75 years, and those with lower social determinants of health barriers are significantly more likely to request a refill via SMS. A neural network-based predictive model with an accuracy level of 78% was used to identify patients who might benefit from additional outreach to narrow identified gaps based on demographic and socioeconomic factors.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31738170/,1,1,USA,4,2019,12,0,-,JMIR Mhealth UHealth,Medicare patients; SMS; conversational AI; health disparities; machine learning; medication adherence; predictive modeling; refill adherence; social determinants of health; text messaging,0,white,USA,4,mPulse Mobile,JD,0,1,asian,USA,4,mPulse Mobile,MSc,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",7,7,7,1,1,"mPulse, Grinnell College, Kaiser Permanente, ","JD, -, BA, PharmD, MSCHCA, BS, MSc",0,Lesotho,0,7,7,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'white', 'white', 'asian']",3,0,0,4,0,7,7,0,43%,

Despite the enthusiasm, health care professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practice.,This paper aims to identify the implementation frameworks used to understand the application of AI in health care practice.,A scoping review was conducted using the Cochrane, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in health care. This review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in health care since 2000. A total of 2541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analyzed against the Nilsen taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and the Greenhalgh framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of health care technologies.,In total, 7 articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, and 2 articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, whereas the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively, the 7 articles identified elements that aligned with all the NASSS domains, but no single article comprehensively considered the factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified, including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision-making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation.,This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI in health care practice is still in its early stages of development. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to provide the knowledge necessary to develop implementation frameworks to guide the future implementation of AI in clinical practice and highlight the opportunity to draw on existing knowledge from the field of implementation science.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35084349/,1,1,,,2022,4,1,Swedish Government Innovation Agency Vinnova and the Knowledge Foundation,J Med Internet Res.,artificial intelligence; implementation framework; scoping review,1,white,Brazil,3,Halmstad University,PhD,0,0,white,Sweden,4,Halmstad University,PhD,0,,"Brazil, Sweden, Sweden, UK, Sweden, Sweden","3,4,4,4,4,4",6,6,6,1,1,"Halmstad University, Santa Catarina State University, Imperial College Business School ","PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD",0,Liberia,1,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Brazil,Sweden,Sweden,UK,Sweden,Sweden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",6,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,100%,

Approximately one-quarter of patient records included gender identity data, and one percent of them indicated a transgender or nonbinary (TGNB) status. Data quality checks suggested limited provider literacy around gender identity as well as limited provider and patient comfort levels with gender identity disclosures. Improvements are needed in both provider and patient literacy and comfort around gender identity in clinical settings. To include TGNB populations in informatics-based research, additional novel approaches, such as natural language processing, may be needed for more comprehensive and representative TGNB cohort discovery. Community and stakeholder engagement around gender identity data collection and health research will likely improve these implementation efforts.",SO/GI data; clinical informatics; nonbinary; population health; transgender health disparities.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34205275/,1,1,USA,4,2021,4,1,Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"SO/GI data, nonbinary, population health, clinical informatics, transgender health disparities",1,white,USA,4,Rush University Medical Center,PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,Rush University Medical Center,MD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"Rush Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine ","PhD, PhD, BA, Msc, PhD",0,Libya,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,100%,

Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced to alleviate some of the limitations of ML, particularly the capability to train on larger datasets for improved performance, which is usually cumbersome for an inter-institutional collaboration due to existing patient protection laws and regulations. Moreover, FL may also play a crucial role in circumventing ML's exigent bias problem by accessing underrepresented groups' data spanning geographically distributed locations. In this paper, we have discussed three FL challenges, namely: privacy of the model exchange, ethical perspectives, and legal considerations. Lastly, we have proposed a model that could aide in assessing data contributions of a FL implementation. In light of the expediency and adaptability of using the S√∏rensen-Dice Coefficient over the more limited (e.g., horizontal FL) and computationally expensive Shapley Values, we sought to demonstrate a new paradigm that we hope, will become invaluable for sharing any profit and responsibilities that may accompany a FL endeavor.",,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.746497/full,1,0,USA,4,2021,2,1,NCI,Front Artif Intell,data sharing; federated learning; machine learning; machine learning legal and ethical issues; machine learning social and regulatory issues,1,white,USA,4,Wake Forest University,PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,Wake Forest School of Medicine,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4",4,4,4,1,1,Wake Forest University,"PhD, -, AA, PhD",0,Liechtenstein,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,100%,

Often, the protected attribute is absent from the training dataset for legal reasons. However, datasets still contain proxy attributes that capture protected information and can inject unfairness in the ML model. Some deployed systems allow auditors, decision makers, or affected users to report issues or seek recourse by flagging individual samples. In this work, we examine such systems and consider a feedback-based framework where the protected attribute is unavailable and the flagged samples are indirect knowledge. The reported samples are used as guidance to identify the proxy attributes that are causally dependent on the (unknown) protected attribute. We work under the causal interventional fairness paradigm. Without requiring the underlying structural causal model a priori, we propose an approach that performs conditional independence tests on observed data to identify such proxy attributes.

To assess this, an NLP algorithm was trained to identify potential surgical candidates using 1097 notes from 175 epilepsy patients with a history of resective epilepsy surgery and 268 patients who achieved seizure freedom without surgery (total N = 443 patients). The model was tested on 8340 notes from 3776 patients with epilepsy whose surgical candidacy status was unknown (2029 male, 1747 female, median age = 9 years; age range = 0-60 years). Multiple linear regression using demographic variables as covariates was used to test for correlations between patient race and surgical candidacy scores. After accounting for other demographic and socioeconomic variables, patient race, gender, and primary language did not influence surgical candidacy scores (P > .35 for all). Higher scores were given to patients >18 years old who traveled farther to receive care, and those who had a higher family income and public insurance (P < .001, .001, .001, and .01, respectively).

Soil samples were collected at the dripline, yard, and street side at 462 households (total sample size = 2310). Samples were analyzed for Pb and then combined with publicly available data on potential historic Pb sources, soil properties, and household and neighborhood demographic characteristics. This curated data set was then analyzed with statistical and machine-learning techniques to identify the drivers of potential soil Pb exposure risks and to build predictive models. Among all samples, 43% exceeded current guidelines for Pb in residential gardens. There were significant racial disparities in potential soil Pb exposure risk; soil Pb at the dripline increased by 19% for every 25% increase in the neighborhood population identifying as Black. A machine-learned Bayesian network model was able to classify residential parcels by risk of exceeding residential gardening standards with excellent reproducibility in cross validation. These findings underscore the need for targeted outreach programs to prevent Pb exposure in residential areas and demonstrate an approach for prioritizing outreach locations.","Bayes Theorem

Application of the rules explains successful US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) de novo authorization of an example, the first autonomous point-of-care diabetic retinopathy examination de novo authorized by the FDA, after a preregistered clinical trial. Physicians need to become competent in understanding the potential risks and benefits of autonomous AI, and understand its design, safety, efficacy and equity, validation, and liability, as well as how its data were obtained.

Consequently, women experience adverse drug reactions from approved drug products more often than men. Distinct differences in pharmaceutical response across drug classes and the lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology also exists between the sexes, often leading to suboptimal drug therapy in women. This review explores the influence of sex as a biological variable in drug delivery, pharmacokinetic response and overall efficacy in the context of pharmaceutical research and practice in the clinic.

The underrepresentation of dark skin images makes diagnosing skin pathology in people of color challenging. In conditions when early diagnosis makes a difference between life and death, such as skin cancer, people of color have a worse prognosis and lower survival rates compared to others with lighter skin tones, as a result of delayed or incorrect diagnoses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence such as deep learning offer a potential solution by diversifying the mostly white skin image repositories and developing inclusive early diagnosis systems.,We aim to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence-based skin cancer early detection system for all skin tones using clinical images through generating diverse skin tone realistic images.,This study consists of four phases: (1) publicly available skin image repositories will be analyzed to quantify the underrepresentation of the darker skin tones, (2) skin images will then be generated for the underrepresented tones, (3) the generated images will be extensively evaluated for realism and disease presentation through quantitative image quality assessment as well as qualitative human expert and non-expert ratings, and (4) the images will be utilized with available white skin images to develop a robust skin cancer early detection model.,This study started in September 2020. The first phase of quantifying the underrepresentation of darker skin tones was completed in March 2021. The second phase of generating the images is in progress and will be completed by March 2022. The third phase is expected to be completed by May 2022, and the final phase is expected to be completed by September 2022.,This work is the first step towards expanding skin tone diversity in existing image databases to address the current gap in the underrepresentation of darker skin tones. Once validated, the generated image bank will present a valuable resource that can potentially be utilized in physician education and other research applications.

What constitutes older age is subjective and flexible, and how one defines older age is influenced by everchanging individual, generational, and cultural expectations. As the global population ages at an unprecedented rate, we are increasingly confronted with a myriad of challenges associated with aging, including increased healthcare needs and the far-reaching negative consequences of individual and structural agism. However, the shift in world demographics toward an older population is not a growing burden, but an opportunity to reshape our view of older life and proactively embrace healthy aging. Indeed, a healthy person is not defined by the absence of illness, but by the potential for meaningful work, positive relationships, and longevity. Simple preventive measures, such as improved diet and increased exercise, can enhance overall health and quality of life, and growing evidence highlights the potential of positive psychology for improving psychological well-being and overall quality of life. Now more than ever, technological innovation including artificial intelligence can be leveraged to improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of aging, as well as the most effective interventions to enhance resilience and extend healthy longevity.

The world's first medical school-based teaching kitchen therefore launched CHOP-Medical Students as the largest known multisite cohort study of hands-on cooking and nutrition education versus traditional curriculum for medical students.,This analysis provides a novel integration of artificial intelligence-based machine learning (ML) with causal inference statistics. 43 ML automated algorithms were tested, with the top performer compared to triply robust propensity score-adjusted multilevel mixed effects regression panel analysis of longitudinal data. Inverse-variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis pooled the individual estimates for competencies.,3,248 unique medical trainees met study criteria from 20 medical schools nationally from August 1, 2012, to June 26, 2017, generating 4,026 completed validated surveys. ML analysis produced similar results to the causal inference statistics based on root mean squared error and accuracy. Hands-on cooking and nutrition education compared to traditional medical school curriculum significantly improved student competencies (OR 2.14, 95% CI 2.00-2.28, p < 0.001) and MedDiet adherence (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.84, p = 0.015), while reducing trainees' soft drink consumption (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p = 0.007). Overall improved competencies were demonstrated from the initial study site through the scale-up of the intervention to 10 sites nationally (p < 0.001).,This study provides the first machine learning-augmented causal inference analysis of a multisite cohort showing hands-on cooking and nutrition education for medical trainees improves their competencies counseling patients on nutrition, while improving students' own diets.

It is the stated policy for gender equity in Papua New Guinea's (PNG) health sector, as well as all other sectors, and is enshrined in the policies of its biggest aid givers. However, there is criticism that gender mainstreaming's application has too often been technocratic and lacking in conceptual clarity not only in PNG but elsewhere. In the health sector this is further exacerbated by a traditional bio-medical approach, which is often paternalistic and insufficiently patient- and family-centered.,This study analyses the policy attitudes toward gender in PNG's health sector using both data-mining and a traditional, summative content analysis.,Our results show that gender is rarely mentioned. When it is, it is most often mentioned in relation to programs such as maternity and childcare for women, and elsewhere is applied technocratically.,For PNG to promote greater levels of equity, the focus should first be on conceptualizing gender in a way that is meaningful for Papuans, taking into account the diversity of experiences and setting.

New combinations of compounds need to be predicted in order to design HAART cocktails. On the one hand, there are the biomolecular factors related to the drugs in the cocktail (experimental measure, chemical structure, drug target, assay organisms, etc.); on the other hand, there are the socioeconomic factors of the specific population (income inequalities, employment levels, fiscal pressure, education, migration, population structure, etc.) to study the relationship between the socioeconomic status and the disease. In this context, machine learning algorithms, able to seek models for problems with multi-source data, have to be used. In this work, the first artificial neural network (ANN) model is proposed for the prediction of HAART cocktails, to halt AIDS on epidemic networks of U.S. counties using information indices that codify both biomolecular and several socioeconomic factors. The data was obtained from at least three major sources. The first dataset included assays of anti-HIV chemical compounds released to ChEMBL. The second dataset is the AIDSVu database of Emory University. AIDSVu compiled AIDS prevalence for >2300 U.S. counties. The third data set included socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Three scales or levels were employed to group the counties according to the location or population structure codes: state, rural urban continuum code (RUCC) and urban influence code (UIC). An analysis of >130,000 pairs (network links) was performed, corresponding to AIDS prevalence in 2310 counties in U.S. vs. drug cocktails made up of combinations of ChEMBL results for 21,582 unique drugs, 9 viral or human protein targets, 4856 protocols, and 10 possible experimental measures. The best model found with the original data was a linear neural network (LNN) with AUROC>0.80 and accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity‚âà77% in training and external validation series. The change of the spatial and population structure scale (State, UIC, or RUCC codes) does not affect the quality of the model. Unbalance was detected in all the models found comparing positive/negative cases and linear/non-linear model accuracy ratios. Using synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), data pre-processing and machine-learning algorithms implemented into the WEKA software, more balanced models were found. In particular, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with AUROC=97.4% and precision, recall, and F-measure >90% was found.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25916548/,1,1,USA,4,2015,19,1,"Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, Spain)",Biosystems,"HIV, epidemiology, Shannon entropy",0,white,Spain,4,"University of A Coruña, Coruña, Spain",PhD,0,1,white,Spain,4,"University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain",MD,0,,"Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain","4, 4, 4, 4, 4",5,5,5,1,1,"University of A Coruña, Spain; University of A Coruña, Spain; University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain; University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain; University of the Basque Country Spain","PhD, PhD, PhD, MD, MD","0, 0, 0, 0, 0",Morocco,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Spain,Spain,Spain,Spain,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white'']",5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,100%,

Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health).

The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves.

In particular, dynamic model ensembles pick the most accurate model for each query object, by applying the model that performed best on similar data. Dynamic model ensembles may however suffer, similarly to single machine learning models, from bias, which can eventually lead to unfair treatment of certain groups of a general population. To mitigate unfair classification, recent work has thus proposed fair model ensembles, that instead of focusing (solely) on accuracy also optimize global fairness. While such global fairness globally minimizes bias, imbalances may persist in different regions of the data, e.g., caused by some local bias maxima leading to local unfairness. Therefore, we extend our previous work by including a framework that bridges the gap between dynamic model ensembles and fair model ensembles. More precisely, we investigate the problem of devising locally fair and accurate dynamic model ensembles, which ultimately optimize for equal opportunity of similar subjects. We propose a general framework to perform this task and present several algorithms implementing the framework components. In this paper we also present a runtime-efficient framework adaptation that keeps the quality of the results on a similar level. Furthermore, new fairness metrics are presented as well as detailed informations about necessary data preparations. Our evaluation of the framework implementations and metrics shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the art for different types and degrees of bias present in training data in terms of both local and global fairness, while reaching comparable accuracy.","Model Fairness

To contextualize recent findings, we offer a summative review of recent literature focused on modeling transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings.,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in the modeling landscape as the healthcare community has raced to characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective interventions. Inequities in COVID-19 outcomes have inspired new efforts to quantify how structural bias impacts both health outcomes and model parameterization. Meanwhile, developments in the modeling of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridioides difficile, and other nosocomial infections continue to advance. Machine learning continues to be applied in novel ways, and genomic data is being increasingly incorporated into modeling efforts.,As the type and amount of data continues to grow, mathematical, statistical, and computational modeling will play an increasing role in healthcare epidemiology.

A central motivation in this regard is to advance patient treatment by reducing human error and increasing the accuracy of prognosis, diagnosis and therapy decisions. There is, however, also increasing awareness about bias in ML technologies and its potentially harmful consequences. Biases refer to systematic distortions of datasets, algorithms, or human decision making. These systematic distortions are understood to have negative effects on the quality of an outcome in terms of accuracy, fairness, or transparency. But biases are not only a technical problem that requires a technical solution. Because they often also have a social dimension, the 'distorted' outcomes they yield often have implications for equity. This paper assesses different types of biases that can emerge within applications of ML in radiology, and discusses in what cases such biases are problematic. Drawing upon theories of equity in healthcare, we argue that while some biases are harmful and should be acted upon, others might be unproblematic and even desirable-exactly because they can contribute to overcome inequities.",,https://insightsimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13244-020-00955-7,1,0,None,None,2021,12,0,0,Insights into Imaging,"radiology, gender, race",0,white,Austria,4,University of Vienna,PhD,0,0,white,Austria,4,University of Vienna,PhD,0,,"Austria, France, Austria","4, 4, 4",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Vienna, Austria; OLEA Medical, La Ciotat, France; University of Vienna, Austria","PhD, PhD, PhD","0,0,0",Nepal,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Austria,France,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white",3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,100%,

This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis.

The impact of recurrent pathogenic variants is often understood, however there is a long tail of rare genetic variants that are uncharacterized. The problem of uncharacterized rare variation is especially acute when it occurs in genes of known clinical importance with functionally consequential variants and associated mechanisms. Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in these genes are discovered at a rate that outpaces current ability to classify them with databases of previous cases, experimental evaluation, and computational predictors. Clinicians are thus left without guidance about the significance of variants that may have actionable consequences. Computational prediction of the impact of rare genetic variation is increasingly becoming an important capability. In this paper, we review the technical and ethical challenges of interpreting the function of rare variants in two settings: inborn errors of metabolism in newborns and pharmacogenomics. We propose a framework for a genomic learning healthcare system with an initial focus on early-onset treatable disease in newborns and actionable pharmacogenomics. We argue that (1) a genomic learning healthcare system must allow for continuous collection and assessment of rare variants, (2) emerging machine learning methods will enable algorithms to predict the clinical impact of rare variants on protein function, and (3) ethical considerations must inform the construction and deployment of all rare-variation triage strategies, particularly with respect to health disparities arising from unbalanced ancestry representation.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33798442/,1,1,None,None,2021,13,1,Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) from The National Institutes of Health,The American Journal of Human Genetics,"genom, genetics, bias",1,white,USA,4,"Stanford University, USA",PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,"Stanford University, USA",PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, India, China, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",14,14,14,1,1,"Stanford University, Stanford, USA; University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA; University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, USA; University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, USA; University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, USA; University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, USA; Paul G.

Even more so since most of them will have a positive effect on society by returning to work. However, many cancer survivors have unmet needs, especially when it comes to improving their quality of life (QoL). Only few survivors are able to meet all of the recommendations regarding well-being and there is a body of evidence that cancer survivors' needs often remain neglected from health policy and national cancer control plans. This increases the impact of inequalities in cancer care and adds a dangerous component to it. The inequalities affect the individual survivor, their career, along with their relatives and society as a whole. The current study will evaluate the impact of the use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on the self-efficacy of participants following intervention supported by digital tools. The secondary endpoints include evaluation of the impact of patient trajectories (from retrospective data) and patient gathered health data on prediction and improved intervention against possible secondary disease or negative outcomes (e.g. late toxicities, fatal events).,The study is designed as a single-case experimental prospective study where each individual serves as its own control group with basal measurements obtained at the recruitment and subsequent measurements performed every 6 months during follow ups. The measurement will involve CASE-cancer, Patient Activation Measure and System Usability Scale. The study will involve 160 survivors (80 survivors of Breast Cancer and 80 survivors of Colorectal Cancer) from four countries, Belgium, Latvia, Slovenia, and Spain. The intervention will be implemented via a digital tool (mHealthApplication), collecting objective biomarkers (vital signs) and subjective biomarkers (PROs) with the support of a (embodied) conversational agent. Additionally, the Clinical Decision Support system (CDSS), including visualization of cohorts and trajectories will enable oncologists to personalize treatment for an efficient care plan and follow-up management.,We expect that cancer survivors will significantly increase their self-efficacy following the personalized intervention supported by the m-HealthApplication compared to control measurements at recruitment.

Adolescents often do not seek clinical help for NSSI and may adopt strategies to obscure detection; therefore, social media platforms may be able to facilitate early detection and treatment by using machine learning models to screen posts for harmful content and subsequently alert adults. However, such efforts have raised privacy and ethical concerns among health researchers. Little is currently known about how adolescents perceive these efforts.,The aim of this study is to examine perceptions of automated alerts for NSSI posts on social media among Latinx adolescents, who are at risk for NSSI yet are underrepresented in both NSSI and health informatics research. In addition, we considered their perspectives on preferred recipients of automated alerts.,We conducted semistructured, qualitative interviews with 42 Latinx adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 years who were recruited from a nonprofit organization serving the Latinx community in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Latinx population in Milwaukee is largely of Mexican descent. All interviews were conducted between June and July 2019. Transcripts were analyzed using framework analysis to discern their perceptions of automated alerts sent by social media platforms and potential alert recipients.,Participants felt that automated alerts would make adolescents safer and expedite aid before the situation escalated. However, some worried that hyperbolic statements would generate false alerts and instigate conflicts. Interviews revealed strong opinions about ideal alert recipients. Parents were most commonly endorsed, but support was conditional on perceptions that the parent would respond appropriately. Emergency services were judged as safer but inappropriate for situations considered lower risk. Alerts sent to school staff generated the strongest privacy concerns. Altogether, the preferred alert recipients varied by individual adolescents and perceived risks in the situation. None raised ethical concerns about the collection, analysis, or storage of personal information regarding their mental health status.,Overall, Latinx adolescents expressed broad support for automated alerts for NSSI on social media, which indicates opportunities to address NSSI. However, these efforts should be co-constructed with adolescents to ensure that preferences and needs are met, as well as embedded within broader approaches for addressing structural and cultural barriers to care.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8386397/,1,1,USA,4,2021,0,1,Technology and Adolescent Mental Wellness program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.,,"race, age, gender",0,white,USA,4,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,PhD,0,0,hispanic,USA,3,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee","PhD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0",Panama,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, hispanic",2,0,1,0,0,3,3,0,67%,

Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than 'one-size-fits-all' guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose's theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations' social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.",Precision nutrition; obesity; obesogenic environments; personalized nutrition; population interventions; social inequalities in health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30544190/,1,0,switzerland,4,2019,21,0,,International journal of epidemiology,"precision nutrition, personalized nutrition, social differences contibuting to obesity , social inequalities in health",0,white,switzerland,4,"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",PhD,0,0,white,Canada,4,"Département de médecine sociale et préventive, Ecole de Santé Publique & Institut de recherche en santé publique de l'Université de Montréal, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada.",Professor of public health,0,,"switzerland, Switzerland, Canada","4,4,4",3,3,3,1,1,"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",Professor of epidemiology,0,Peru,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,switzerland,Switzerland,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white']",3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,100%,

It differs from precision medicine in terms of its focus on populations and the limited role of human genomics. High-resolution spatial analysis in a global health context and application of genomics to infectious organisms are areas of progress. Opportunities for informatics research include (i) the development of frameworks for measuring non-clinical concepts, such as social position, (ii) the development of methods for learning from similar populations, and (iii) the evaluation of precision public health implementations. Just as the effects of interventions can differ across populations, predictive models can perform systematically differently across subpopulations due to information bias, sampling bias, random error, and the choice of the output. Algorithm developers, professional societies, and governments can take steps to prevent and mitigate these biases. However, even if the steps to avoid bias are clear in theory, they can be very challenging to accomplish in practice.,Both precision public health and predictive modelling require careful consideration in how subpopulations are defined and access to data on subpopulations can be challenging.

Herein, we discuss how concepts of algorithmic fairness might apply in healthcare, where predictive algorithms are being increasingly used to support decision-making. Central to our discussion is the distinction between algorithmic fairness and algorithmic bias. Fairness concerns apply specifically when algorithms are used to support polar decisions (i.e., where one pole of prediction leads to decisions that are generally more desired than the other), such as when predictions are used to allocate scarce health care resources to a group of patients that could all benefit. We review different fairness criteria and demonstrate their mutual incompatibility. Even when models are used to balance benefits-harms to make optimal decisions for individuals (i.e., for non-polar decisions)-and fairness concerns are not germane-model, data or sampling issues can lead to biased predictions that support decisions that are differentially harmful/beneficial across groups. We review these potential sources of bias, and also discuss ways to diagnose and remedy algorithmic bias. We note that remedies for algorithmic fairness may be more problematic, since we lack agreed upon definitions of fairness. Finally, we propose a provisional framework for the evaluation of clinical prediction models offered for further elaboration and refinement.

Data came from CCNC's Case Management Information System, Medicaid claims, and birth certificates. Logistic regression with backward stepwise elimination was used to arrive at the final models. To internally validate the predictive model, we used bootstrapping techniques.,The prevalence of PTB was 11 %. Multifetal gestation, a previous PTB, cervical insufficiency, diabetes, renal disease, and hypertension were the strongest risk factors with odds ratios ranging from 2.34 to 10.78. Non-Hispanic black race, underweight, smoking during pregnancy, asthma, other chronic conditions, nulliparity, and a history of a low birth weight infant or fetal death/second trimester loss were additional predictors in the final predictive model. About half of the risk factors prioritized by the PMH program remained in our final model (ROC = 0.66). The odds of PTB associated with food insecurity and obesity differed by parity. The influence of unsafe or unstable housing and short interpregnancy interval on PTB differed by race/ethnicity.,Evaluation of the PMH risk screen provides insight to ensure women at highest risk are prioritized for care management.

We replicated our process in the 2016 BRFSS survey.,We analyzed data from 449,492 adult participants of the 2017 BRFSS survey.,We examined area under the curve (AUC) statistics to examine model fit within each group. We used traditional logistic regression to predict self-rated health associated with features identified by machine learning models.,Each algorithm, regularized logistic regression (AUC: 0.81), random forest (AUC: 0.80), and support vector machine (AUC: 0.81), provided good model fit in the BRFSS. Predictors of self-rated health were similar by sex and race/ethnicity but differed by age. Socioeconomic features were prominent predictors of self-rated health in mid-life age groups.

Sexual minority women (SMW) in the United States experience multiple health disparities including decreased access to and use of cervical cancer screening. The mechanisms driving these disparities are not clear and SMW with multiple marginalized identities may be more likely to miss recommended cervical cancer screening. This study aimed to identify subgroups of SMW that are more and less likely to be screened for cervical cancer according to American Cancer Society guidelines. We used cross-sectional data from the latest (2010-2012) wave of the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women (CHLEW) Study (N = 691). Informed by intersectionality theory, we performed classification and regression tree (CART) modeling to construct a data-driven, predictive model of subgroups of SMW who were more and less likely to receive guideline-recommended screening. Notably, the CART model did not include commonly tested variables such as race/ethnicity or level of income or education. The model did identify subgroups with low likelihood of receiving screening and several novel variables that may be important in understanding SMW's use of cervical cancer screening; lifetime number of sexual partners, age at drinking onset, childhood physical abuse, and internalized homonegativity. Our results point to the importance of early life experiences and identity development processes in shaping patterns of preventive healthcare use among adult SMW.

Despite advancements in prevention and treatment, CVD is still the leading cause of death in the United States. Additionally, research indicates that African American (AA) and other ethnic-minority populations are affected by CVD at earlier ages than white Americans. Given that AAs are the fastest-growing population of smartphone owners and users, mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer the unparalleled potential to prevent or improve self-management of chronic disease among this population.,To address the unmet need for culturally tailored primordial prevention CVD-focused mHealth interventions, the MOYO app was cocreated with the involvement of young people from this priority community. The overall project aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a novel smartphone app designed to reduce CVD risk factors among urban-AAs, 18-29 years of age.,The theoretical underpinning will combine the principles of community-based participatory research and the agile software development framework. The primary outcome goals of the study will be to determine the usability, acceptability, and functionality of the MOYO app, and to build a cloud-based data collection infrastructure suitable for digital epidemiology in a disparity population. Changes in health-related parameters over a 24-week period as determined by both passive (eg, physical activity levels, sleep duration, social networking) and active (eg, use of mood measures, surveys, uploading pictures of meals and blood pressure readings) measures will be the secondary outcome. Participants will be recruited from a majority AA ""large city"" school district, 2 historically black colleges or universities, and 1 urban undergraduate college. Following baseline screening for inclusion (administered in person), participants will receive the beta version of the MOYO app. Participants will be monitored during a 24-week pilot period. Analyses of varying data including social network dynamics, standard metrics of activity, percentage of time away from a given radius of home, circadian rhythm metrics, and proxies for sleep will be performed. Together with external variables (eg, weather, pollution, and socioeconomic indicators such as food access), these metrics will be used to train machine-learning frameworks to regress them on the self-reported quality of life indicators.,This 5-year study (2015-2020) is currently in the implementation phase.

However, evidence indicates that such algorithms have the potential to worsen disparities currently intrinsic to the contemporary healthcare system, including racial biases. Blame for these deficiencies has often been placed on the algorithm-but the underlying training data bears greater responsibility for these errors, as biased outputs are inexorably produced by biased inputs. The utility, equity, and generalizability of predictive models depend on population-representative training data with robust feature sets. So while the conventional paradigm of big data is deductive in nature-clinical decision support-a future model harnesses the potential of big data for inductive reasoning. This may be conceptualized as clinical decision questioning, intended to liberate the human predictive process from preconceived lenses in data solicitation and/or interpretation. Efficacy, representativeness and generalizability are all heightened in this schema. Thus, the possible risks of biased big data arising from the inputs themselves must be acknowledged and addressed. Awareness of data deficiencies, structures for data inclusiveness, strategies for data sanitation, and mechanisms for data correction can help realize the potential of big data for a personalized medicine era. Applied deliberately, these considerations could help mitigate risks of perpetuation of health inequity amidst widespread adoption of novel applications of big data.",,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0157-2,1,0,USA,4,2019,66,0,,NPJ digital medicine,"algorithms have the potential to worsen disparities currently intrinsic to the contemporary healthcare system, including racial biases.",1,white,USA,4,Stanford University,MD,0,1,white,USA,4,Stanford University,"MD,MS",0,,"USA, USA, India, USA","4,4,2,4",4,4,4,1,1,Stanford University,"MD, MSc",0,Saint Lucia,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,India,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'hispanic', 'asian', 'white']",2,0,1,1,0,4,4,0,50%,

There is currently no readily available data set to provide a systematic means of measuring the out-of-pocket costs incurred by patients with cancer within Australia. The primary aim of the project is to quantify the direct out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure of individuals in the state of Queensland, who are diagnosed with cancer.,This project will build Australia's first model (called CancerCostMod) of out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure of patients with cancer using administrative data from Queensland Cancer Registry, for all individuals diagnosed with any cancer in Queensland between 1 July 2011 and 30 June 2012, linked to their Admitted Patient Data Collection, Emergency Department Information System, Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme records from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2015. No identifiable information will be provided to the authors. The project will use a combination of linear and logistic regression modelling, Cox proportional hazards modelling and machine learning to identify differences in survival, total health system expenditure, total out-of-pocket expenditure and high out-of-pocket cost patients, adjusting for demographic and clinical confounders, and income group, Indigenous status and geographic location. Results will be analysed separately for different types of cancer.,Human Research Ethics approval has been obtained from the Townsville Hospital and Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/16/QTHS/110) and James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (H6678).

Global disease prevalence was determined for male and female patients in 11 disease categories from the Global Burden of Disease database: cardiovascular, diabetes, digestive, hepatitis (types A, B, C, and E), HIV/AIDS, kidney (chronic), mental, musculoskeletal, neoplasms, neurological, and respiratory (chronic). Machine reading algorithms were developed that extracted sex data from tables in articles and records on December 31, 2018, at an artificial intelligence research institute. Male and female participants in 43 135 articles (792 004 915 participants) and 13 165 records (12 977 103 participants) were included.,Sex bias was defined as the difference between the fraction of female participants in study participants minus prevalence fraction of female participants for each disease category. A total of 1000 bootstrap estimates of sex bias were computed by resampling individual studies with replacement. Sex bias was reported as mean and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals from articles and records in each disease category over time (before or during 1993 to 2018), with studies or participants as the measurement unit.,There were 792 004 915 participants, including 390 470 834 female participants (49%), in articles and 12 977 103 participants, including 6 351 619 female participants (49%), in records. With studies as measurement unit, substantial female underrepresentation (sex bias ‚â§ -0.05) was observed in 7 of 11 disease categories, especially HIV/AIDS (mean for articles, -0.17 [95% CI, -0.18 to -0.16]), chronic kidney diseases (mean, -0.17 [95% CI, -0.17 to -0.16]), and cardiovascular diseases (mean, -0.14 [95% CI, -0.14 to -0.13]). Sex bias in articles for all categories combined was unchanged over time with studies as measurement unit (range, -0.15 [95% CI, -0.16 to -0.13] to -0.10 [95% CI, -0.14 to -0.06]), but improved from before or during 1993 (mean, -0.11 [95% CI, -0.16 to -0.05]) to 2014 to 2018 (mean, -0.05 [95% CI, -0.09 to -0.02]) with participants as the measurement unit. Larger study size was associated with greater female representation.,Automated extraction of the number of participants in clinical reports provides an effective alternative to manual analysis of demographic bias. Despite legal and policy initiatives to increase female representation, sex bias against female participants in clinical studies persists. Studies with more participants have greater female representation. Differences between sex bias estimates with studies vs participants as measurement unit, and between articles vs records, suggest that sex bias with both measures and data sources should be reported.",,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2737103,1,1,USA,4,2019,85,0,,JAMA network open,Analyses of female representation in clinical studies,1,white,USA,4,"Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Seattle, Washington",PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,"Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Seattle, Washington",PhD,0,,"USA, Egypt, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,3,4,4,4,4",6,6,6,1,1,"Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Seattle, Washington",PhD,0,San Marino,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,Egypt,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'asian', 'asian', '-', 'white', 'white']",3,0,0,2,1,6,6,0,50%,

There is an urgent need for the discovery of novel molecular signatures for HCV disease progression to understand the underlying biological basis for this cancer rate disparity to improve the clinical outcome.,We performed differential proteomics with isobaric labeling tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and MS/MS analysis to identify proteins differentially expressed in cirrhotic (CIR) and HCC as compared to normal tissues of Caucasian American (CA) patients. The raw data were analyzed using the ProteinPilot v3.0. Searches were performed against all known sequences populating the Swiss-Prot, Refseq, and TrEMBL databases. Quality control analyses were accomplished using pairwise correlation plots, boxplots, principal component analysis, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Supervised analysis was carried out to identify differentially expressed proteins. Candidates were validated in independent cohorts of CA and AA tissues by qRT-PCR or Western blotting.,A total of 238 unique proteins were identified. Of those, around 15% were differentially expressed between normal, CIR & HCC groups. Target validation demonstrates racially distinct alteration in the expression of certain proteins. For example, the mRNA expression levels of transferrin (TF) were 2 and18-fold higher in CIR and HCC in AA as compared to CA. Similarly; the expression of Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) was 7-fold higher in HCC of AA. This increase was mirrored in the protein expression levels. Interestingly, the level of hepatocyte nuclear factor4a (HNF4a) protein was down regulated in AA, whereas repression of transcription is seen more in CA compared to AA. These data suggest that racial disparities in HCC could be a consequence of differential dysregulation of HNF4a transcriptional activity.,This study identifies novel molecular signatures in HCV-induced HCC using iTRAQ-based tissue proteomics. The proteins identified will further enhance a molecular explanation to the biochemical mechanism(s) that may play a role in HCC racial disparities.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24283668/,1,1,USA,4,2013,21,0,,Journal of translational medicine,"Hepatocellular carcinoma, Hepatitis C, Tissue proteomics, Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), Cancer racial disparity",1,white,USA,4,"Beth israel, Harvard university",MD,0,1,black,USA,4,"Beth israel, harvard university US",PhD,0,,"USA, India, China, USA, USA","4,2,3,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"Beth Israel, winship cancer institute,  Washington State University, Washington State University, Beth Israel","MD, PhD, Phd, Phd, Phd,",,Sao Tome & Principe,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,India,China,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'black']",1,1,0,3,0,5,5,0,20%,

Color fundus photography (CFP) is the most cost-effective imaging modality to screen for retinal disorders. However, its application to glaucoma has been limited to the computation of a few related biomarkers such as the vertical cup-to-disc ratio. Deep learning approaches, although widely applied for medical image analysis, have not been extensively used for glaucoma assessment due to the limited size of the available data sets. Furthermore, the lack of a standardize benchmark strategy makes difficult to compare existing methods in a uniform way. In order to overcome these issues we set up the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge, REFUGE (https://refuge.grand-challenge.org), held in conjunction with MICCAI 2018. The challenge consisted of two primary tasks, namely optic disc/cup segmentation and glaucoma classification. As part of REFUGE, we have publicly released a data set of 1200 fundus images with ground truth segmentations and clinical glaucoma labels, currently the largest existing one. We have also built an evaluation framework to ease and ensure fairness in the comparison of different models, encouraging the development of novel techniques in the field. 12 teams qualified and participated in the online challenge. This paper summarizes their methods and analyzes their corresponding results. In particular, we observed that two of the top-ranked teams outperformed two human experts in the glaucoma classification task. Furthermore, the segmentation results were in general consistent with the ground truth annotations, with complementary outcomes that can be further exploited by ensembling the results.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841519301100,1,1,global,,2020,221,0,,Medical image analysis,Deep learning; Fundus photography; Glaucoma; Image classification; Image segmentation.,1,hispanic,Austria,4,"Christian Doppler Laboratory for Ophthalmic Image Analysis (OPTIMA), Vienna Reading Center (VRC), Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090 Vienna, Austria.",PhD,0,1,white,Austria,4,"Christian Doppler Laboratory for Ophthalmic Image Analysis (OPTIMA), Vienna Reading Center (VRC), Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090 Vienna, Austria.",PhD,0,,"Argentina, China, Portugal, Belgium, India, Colombia, China, China, South Korea, South Korea, South Korea, China, China, China, India, Spain, India, India, India, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, Austria","3, 3, 4, 4,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,3,3,3,2,4,2,2,2,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4",31,31,31,1,1,,,,Saudi Arabia,0,31,31,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Argentina,China,Portugal,Belgium,India,Colombia,China,China,South Korea,South Korea,South Korea,China,China,China,India,Spain,India,India,India,South Korea,Australia,Hong Kong,China,China,China,China,China,China,China,China,Austria,,,,,,,"['hispanic', 'asian', 'white', 'white', 'asian', 'hispanic', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'white', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'white', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'white']",5,0,2,24,0,31,31,0,16%,

Although various risk factors are known to influence the development of this disease, a full comprehension of the etiology and treatment for different patient populations remains elusive. For instance, racial minorities are disproportionally affected by this disease and typically have worse prognosis, possibly due to environmental and genetic disparities. Although research into CHD has highlighted a wide range of causal factors, the reasons for these differences seen in different patient populations are not fully known. Cardiovascular disease modeling using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a novel approach for investigating possible genetic variants in CHD that may be race specific, making it a valuable tool to help solve the mystery of higher incidence and mortality rates among minorities. Herein, we first review the prevalence, risk factors, and genetics of CHD and then discuss the use of iPSCs, omics, and machine learning technologies to investigate the etiology of CHD and its connection to racial disparities.

The health of its population is an important part of the capital of a nation. We examined the association between individual level poverty and disability and racial mortality differences in a 5% Medicare beneficiary random sample from 2004 to 2010. Cox regression models examined associations of race with all-cause mortality, adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, disability, neighborhood income, and Medicare ""Buy-in"" status (a proxy for individual level poverty) in 1,190,510 Black and White beneficiaries between 65 and 99 years old as of January 1, 2014, who had full and primary Medicare Part A and B coverage in 2004, and lived in one of the 50 states or Washington DC. Overall, black beneficiaries had higher sex-and-age adjusted mortality than Whites (hazard ratio [HR] 1.18). Controlling for health-related measures and disability reduced the HR for Black beneficiaries to 1.03. Adding ""Buy-in"" as an individual level covariate lowered the HR for Black beneficiaries to 0.92. Neither of the residential measures added to the predictive model. We conclude that poorer health status, excess disability, and most importantly, greater poverty among Black beneficiaries accounts for racial mortality differences in the aged US Medicare population. Poverty fosters social and health inequalities, including mortality disparities, notwithstanding national health insurance for the US elderly. Controlling for individual level poverty, in contrast to the common use of area level poverty in previous analyses, accounts for the White survival advantage in Medicare beneficiaries, and should be a covariate in analyses of administrative databases.",Buy-in; Dual-eligible; Medicaid; Medicare; USA; USRDS; disability; disparities; mortality; neighborhood; poverty; race; socioeconomic status.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27152319/,1,1,USA,4,2016,37,1,"US National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institute of Health (HHSN 276201200161U)",SSM population health,Medicaid; Medicare; USA; USRDS; disability; disparities; mortality; neighborhood; poverty; race; socioeconomic status; mortality in medicaid patients in different socioeconomic status,1,white,USA,4,"NIH, USA",PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,NIH,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"National Institutes of Health, Social & Scientific Systems, National Institutes of Health, WeStat, National Institutes of Health","MD, -,MPH, PHD, Phd","0,0,0,0,0",Serbia,1,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'asian', 'white', 'white', 'white']",4,0,0,1,0,5,5,0,80%,

Over the last several years, the quality of these systems has dramatically improved, due both to advances in deep learning and to the collection of large-scale datasets used to train the systems. There is concern, however, that these tools do not work equally well for all subgroups of the population. Here, we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art ASR systems-developed by Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft-to transcribe structured interviews conducted with 42 white speakers and 73 black speakers. In total, this corpus spans five US cities and consists of 19.8 h of audio matched on the age and gender of the speaker. We found that all five ASR systems exhibited substantial racial disparities, with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers. We trace these disparities to the underlying acoustic models used by the ASR systems as the race gap was equally large on a subset of identical phrases spoken by black and white individuals in our corpus. We conclude by proposing strategies-such as using more diverse training datasets that include African American Vernacular English-to reduce these performance differences and ensure speech recognition technology is inclusive.",,https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915768117,1,1,USA,4,2020,230,0,,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,racial disparities in automated speech recognition (ASR) systems,0,white,USA,4,Stanford University,PhD,0,1,asian,USA,4,Stanford University,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, United Kingdom, USA, USA, USA, USA, Guyana, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4,4",10,10,10,1,1,"Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford University, Georgetown University, Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford University, Stanford University","PhD, Phd, Phd, AB, PHD, Phd, BA, Phd, Phd, Phd","0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",Seychelles,0,10,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,UK,USA,USA,USA,USA,Guyana,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, asian, white, white, black, black, asian, black, white, asian",4,3,0,3,0,10,10,0,40%,

At the same time, concern over the lack of attention to the underlying assumptions and unintended health consequences of such practices, particularly the widespread use of race-based algorithms, from the simple to the complex, has caught the attention of both physicians and social scientists. Epistemological debates over the meaning of ""the social"" and ""the scientific"" are consequential in discussions of race and racism in medicine. In this paper, we examine the socio-scientific processes by which one algorithm that ""corrects"" for kidney function in African Americans became central to knowledge production about chronic kidney disease (CKD). Correction factors are now used extensively and routinely in clinical laboratories and medical practices throughout the US. Drawing on close textual analysis of the biomedical literature, we use the theoretical frameworks of science and technology studies to critically analyze the initial development of the race-based algorithm, its uptake, and its normalization.

","Medical AI is increasingly being developed and tested to improve medical diagnosis, prediction and treatment of a wide array of medical conditions. Despite worries about the explainability and accuracy of such medical AI systems, it is reasonable to assume that they will be increasingly implemented in medical practice. Current ethical debates focus mainly on design requirements and suggest embedding certain values such as transparency, fairness, and explainability in the design of medical AI systems. Aside from concerns about their design, medical AI systems also raise questions with regard to physicians' responsibilities once these technologies are being implemented and used. How do physicians' responsibilities change with the implementation of medical AI? Which set of competencies do physicians have to learn to responsibly interact with medical AI? In the present article, we will introduce the notion of forward-looking responsibility and enumerate through this conceptual lens a number of competencies and duties that physicians ought to employ to responsibly utilize medical AI in practice. Those include amongst others understanding the range of reasonable outputs, being aware of own experience and skill decline, and monitoring potential accuracy decline of the AI systems.

Part 2: Exploring the ethical implications of its application in primary care practice,"Background: eHealth promises to increase self-management and personalised medicine and improve cost-effectiveness in primary care. Paired with these promises are ethical implications, as eHealth will affect patients' and primary care professionals' (PCPs) experiences, values, norms, and relationships.Objectives: We argue what ethical implications related to the impact of eHealth on four vital aspects of primary care could (and should) be anticipated.Discussion: (1) EHealth influences dealing with predictive and diagnostic uncertainty. Machine-learning based clinical decision support systems offer (seemingly) objective, quantified, and personalised outcomes. However, they also introduce new loci of uncertainty and subjectivity. The decision-making process becomes opaque, and algorithms can be invalid, biased, or even discriminatory. This has implications for professional responsibilities and judgments, justice, autonomy, and trust. (2) EHealth affects the roles and responsibilities of patients because it can stimulate self-management and autonomy. However, autonomy can also be compromised, e.g. in cases of persuasive technologies and eHealth can increase existing health disparities. (3) The delegation of tasks to a network of technologies and stakeholders requires attention for responsibility gaps and new responsibilities. (4) The triangulate relationship: patient-eHealth-PCP requires a reconsideration of the role of human interaction and 'humanness' in primary care as well as of shaping Shared Decision Making.Conclusion: Our analysis is an essential first step towards setting up a dedicated ethics research agenda that should be examined in parallel to the development and implementation of eHealth.

Despite highly motivated national and global health strategies, there remains significant health care inequity. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including a number of biases, are key drivers of ongoing health inequity including equity of access and opportunity for nuclear medicine and radiology services. There is a substantial gap in the global practice of nuclear medicine in particular, but also radiology, between developed health economies and those considered developing or undeveloped. At a local level, even in developed health economies, there can be a significant disparity between health services, including medical imaging, between communities based on socioeconomic, cultural or geographic differences. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to either widen the health inequity divide or substantially reduce it. Distributed generally, AI technology could be used to overcome geographic boundaries to health care, thus bringing general and specialist care into underserved communities. However, should AI technology be limited to localities already enjoying ample healthcare access and direct access to health infrastructure, like radiology and nuclear medicine, it could then accentuate the gap. There are a number of challenges across the AI pipeline that need careful attention to ensure beneficence over maleficence. Fully realized, AI augmented health care could be crafted as an integral part of the broader strategy convergence on local, national and global health equity.

","Racial/ethnic minorities experience disproportionate rates of depressive symptoms in the United States. The magnitude that underlying factors-such as social inequalities-contribute to these symptoms is unknown. We sought to identify exposures that explain racial/ethnic differences in clinically significant depressive symptomology among men who have sex with men (MSM).,Data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a prospective cohort study, were used to examine clinically significant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score ‚â• 20) among non-Latinx White, non-Latinx Black, and Latinx MSM. We included 44,823 person-visits by 1729 MSM seen in the study sites of Baltimore/Washington, DC; Chicago; Pittsburgh/Columbus; and Los Angeles from 2000 to 2017. Regression models estimated the percentage of depressive symptom risk explained by social, treatment, and health-related variables related to race/ethnicity. Machine-learning methods were used to predict the impact of mitigating differences in determinants of depressive symptoms by race/ethnicity.,At the most recent non-missing MACS visit, 16% of non-Latinx White MSM reported clinically significant depressive symptoms, compared to 22% of non-Latinx Black and 25% of Latinx men. We found that income and social-environmental stress were the largest contributors to racial/ethnic disparities in risk for depressive symptoms. Similarly, setting the prevalence of these two exposures to be equal across racial/ethnic groups was estimated to be most effective at reducing levels of clinically significant depressive symptoms.,Results suggested that reducing socioeconomic inequalities and stressful experiences may be effective public health targets to decrease racial/ethnic disparities in depressive symptoms among MSM.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870462/,1,1,USA,4,2021,3,1,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology,"Social inequalities, , Depressive symptoms, Men who have sex with men, Racial/ethnic health disparities, USA",1,white,USA,4,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,M.Sc,0,0,White,USA,4,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",9,9,9,1,1,"Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins University,Johns Hopkins University, Georgetown University, University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University, Northwestern University Chicago, University of California Los Angeles, Johns Hopkins University","M.Sc, PhD, ScD,PhD, PhD, ScD, PhD, DrPH, PhD","0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",Sri Lanka,0,9,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",9,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,100%,

It has been argued that AI is experiencing a fast process of commodification. This characterization correctly reflects the current process of industrialization of AI and its reach into society. Therefore, societal issues related to the use of AI and ML should not be ignored any longer and certainly not in the medical domain. These societal issues may take many forms, but they all entail the design of models from a human-centred perspective, incorporating human-relevant requirements and constraints. In this brief paper, we discuss a number of specific issues affecting the use of AI and ML in medicine, such as fairness, privacy and anonymity, explainability and interpretability, but also some broader societal issues, such as ethics and legislation. We reckon that all of these are relevant aspects to consider in order to achieve the objective of fostering acceptance of AI- and ML-based technologies, as well as to comply with an evolving legislation concerning the impact of digital technologies on ethically and privacy sensitive matters. Our specific goal here is to reflect on how all these topics affect medical applications of AI and ML. This paper includes some of the contents of the ""2nd Meeting of Science and Dialysis: Artificial Intelligence,"" organized in the Bellvitge University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.,AI and ML are attracting much interest from the medical community as key approaches to knowledge extraction from data.

We conducted a comprehensive global study investigating the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published on different health conditions, and how this compares with the global disease burden that they impose.,We use machine learning to monitor PubMed daily, and find and analyse RCT reports. We assessed RCTs investigating the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from the Global Burden of Disease study. Using regression models, we compared numbers of actual RCTs in different health conditions to numbers predicted from their global disease burden (disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)). We investigated whether RCT numbers differed for conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socioeconomic development.,We estimate 463 000 articles describing RCTs (95% prediction interval 439 000 to 485 000) were published from 1990 to July 2020. RCTs recruited a median of 72 participants (IQR 32-195). 82% of RCTs were conducted by researchers in the top fifth of countries by socio-economic development. As DALYs increased for a particular health condition by 10%, the number of RCTs in the same year increased by 5% (3.2%-6.9%), but the association was weak (adjusted R2=0.13). Conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socioeconomic development, including respiratory infections and tuberculosis (7000 RCTs below predicted) and enteric infections (9700 RCTs below predicted), appear relatively under-researched for their disease burden. Each 10% shift in DALYs towards countries with low and middle socioeconomic development was associated with a 4% reduction in RCTs (3.7%-4.9%). These disparities have not changed substantially over time.,Research priorities are not well optimised to reduce the global burden of disease.

Survivorship care plans (SCPs) are an important tool for improving patient outcomes and provide critical information to both survivors and health care professionals. Recent efforts have been made to expand SCP utilization; however, which patients currently receive SCPs is poorly understood.,This study used 596 individuals with a diagnosis of melanoma (n = 391) or nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 205) who had used an Internet-based SCP tool from May 2010 to December 2016 to model the patient and provider characteristics that determine SCP utilization.,Survivors were predominantly white (95.3%) and female (56.5%). Survivors who received a treatment summary were more likely to also receive an SCP. University and nonuniversity cancer centers used SCPs at a higher rate than other care settings. Survivors whose care was managed by a team rather than just an individual physician were also more likely to receive an SCP. Survivors older than 70 years at diagnosis were almost twice as likely to receive a plan as survivors who were diagnosed at a younger age.,With a convenience sample of skin cancer survivors, it is possible to model factors that predict the receipt of SCPs. Important variables include the diagnosis age, treatment setting, physician type, and treatment-summary utilization. A closer examination of these variables identified several disparities in care-plan use and, therefore, opportunities to improve the distribution of SCPs. Further validation in additional cohorts of survivors is necessary to confirm these conclusions.

In cases in which restrictions should be enacted, policies are proposed. The adaptation of current tort and anti-discrimination laws is found to guarantee an optimal level of interpretability and fairness.

Healthcare in the United States (U.S.) is at a critical juncture characterized by: (1) a growing need for healthcare and rehabilitation services; (2) maturing technological capabilities to support more effective and efficient health services; (3) evolving public policies designed, by turns, to contain cost and support new models of care; and (4) a growing need to ensure acceptance and usability of new health technologies by people with disabilities and chronic conditions, clinicians and health delivery systems. Discussion of demographic and population health data, healthcare service delivery and a public policy primarily focuses on the U.S. However, trends identified (aging populations, growing prevalence of chronic conditions and disability, labor shortages in healthcare) apply to most countries with advanced economies and others.

But it also poses substantial new hazards, including algorithmic discrimination. For example, an algorithm used to identify candidates for beneficial ""high risk care management"" programs routinely failed to select racial minorities. Furthermore, some algorithms deliberately adjust for race in ways that divert resources away from minority patients. To illustrate, algorithms have underestimated African Americans' risks of kidney stones and death from heart failure. Algorithmic discrimination can violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act when it unjustifiably disadvantages underserved populations. This article urges that both legal and technical tools be deployed to promote AI fairness. Plaintiffs should be able to assert disparate impact claims in health-care litigation, and Congress should enact an Algorithmic Accountability Act.

A number of indices have been developed to track female empowerment at the national level, but these are incomplete and may obscure important sub-national variation. We developed the Female Empowerment Index (FEMI) to track multiple domains of women's empowerment at the sub-national level. The index is based on six categories of empowerment: violence against women, employment, education, reproductive healthcare, decision making, and access to contraceptives. The FEMI has a range of zero to one (low to high empowerment), and it is calculated as the mean proportion of positive outcomes in the six categories. To provide a proof of concept, we computed the FEMI for Nigeria and its 36 states from five Demographic and Health Surveys between the years of 1990 and 2013, using questions asked to 98,542 women between 15 and 49 years old. At the national level, the FEMI increased from 0.34 to 0.48. However, there was substantial sub-national variation, with state-level values ranging from 0.16-0.60 in 1990 to 0.19-0.73 in 2013. Our findings thus illustrate the importance of considering sub-national variation in female empowerment.

We refined and enriched these results with a series of expert interviews up to 1 h in length, including representatives from HTA agencies, research councils and researchers designed to cover a wide spectrum of precision medicine applications and research.,We identified 31 relevant papers and interviewed 13 experts. We found that three types of precision medicine are expected to emerge in clinical practice: complex algorithms, digital health applications and 'omics'-based tests. These are expected to impact upon each stage of the HTA process, from scoping and modelling through to decision-making and review. The complex and uncertain treatment pathways associated with patient stratification and fast-paced technological innovation are central to these effects.,Innovation in precision medicine promises substantial benefits but will change the way in which some health services are delivered and evaluated.

Partial dependence analysis was performed to measure the independent impact of race on the ensembles.,The guided ML ensembles predicted non-home disposition (area under the curve, 0.796) and extended LOS (area under the curve, 0.824) with good discrimination. Partial dependence analysis showed that black race increases the risk of non-home discharge and extended LOS over white race by 6.9% and 6.5%, respectively. Other, nonblack race increases the risk of extended LOS over white race by 6.0%.

Advances in precision medicine have shifted the research focus toward underlying genetic differences. However, nonbiological factors may have a large role in these observed disparities. Therefore, we sought to measure the relative importance of race compared to health care and social factors on prostate cancer specific mortality.,Using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database we identified 514,878 men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 40 years or greater between 2004 and 2012. We also selected a subset of black and white men matched by age, stage and birth year. We stratified patients by age 40 to 54, 55 to 69 and 70 years or older and disease stage, resulting in 18 groups. By applying random forest methods with variable importance measures we analyzed 15 variables and interactions across 4 categories of factors (tumor characteristics, race, and health care and social factors) and the relative importance for prostate cancer specific mortality.,Tumor characteristics at diagnosis were the most important factors for prostate cancer mortality. Across all groups race was less than 5% as important as tumor characteristics and only more important than health care and social factors in 2 of the 18 groups. Although race had a significant impact, health care and social factors known to be associated with racial disparities had greater or similarly important effects across all ages and stages.,Eradicating disparities in prostate cancer survival will require a multipronged approach, including advances in precision medicine.

To prevent the introduction bias in health care AI, the physician community should work with developers and regulators to develop pathways to ensure that algorithms marketed for widespread clinical practice are safe, effective, and free of unintended bias. The ACR Data Science Institute has developed structured AI use cases with data elements that allow the development of standardized data sets for AI testing and training across multiple institutions to promote the availability of diverse data for algorithm development. Additionally, the ACR Data Science Institute validation and monitoring services, ACR Certify-AI and ACR Assess-AI, incorporate standards to mitigate algorithm bias and promote health equity.

With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better.

Some claim that organics have ecological, equity, and health advantages over conventional food and therefore should be subsidized. Here we explore the distributive impacts of an organic fruit subsidy that reduces the retail price of organic fruit in the US by 10 percent. We estimate the impact of the subsidy on organic fruit demand in a representative poor, middle income, and rich US household using three analytical methods; including two econometric and one machine learning. We do not find strong evidence of regressive redistribution due to our simulated organic fruit subsidy; the poor household's relative reaction to the subsidy is not much different than the reaction at the other two households.

In all these cases, evidence has accumulated that we use the specific neural networks engaged in processing mental states in ourselves to understand the same mental states in others. However, the magnitude of the brain activity in these shared networks is modulated by contextual appraisal of the situation or the other person. An important feature of decision making in a social setting concerns the interaction of reason and emotion.

At the same time, a variety of issues have been identified with the machine learning models used to analyze social data. These issues range from technical problems with the data used and features constructed, to problematic modeling assumptions, to limited interpretability, to the models' contributions to bias and inequality. Computational researchers have sought out technical solutions to these problems. The primary contribution of the present work is to argue that there is a limit to these technical solutions. At this limit, we must instead turn to social theory. We show how social theory can be used to answer basic methodological and interpretive questions that technical solutions cannot when building machine learning models, and when assessing, comparing, and using those models. In both cases, we draw on related existing critiques, provide examples of how social theory has already been used constructively in existing work, and discuss where other existing work may have benefited from the use of specific social theories.

This scoping review describes and identifies gaps in the measurement tools, methods, and indicators used to measure GEWE in humanitarian settings, and presents a dashboard that can be used by researchers, organizations and governments to identify GEWE measurement tools.,Scientific articles published between January 2004 and November 2019 were identified using Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, and PAIS index. Relevant non peer-reviewed literature was downloaded from the websites of humanitarian organizations. Publications on women and/or girls impacted by a humanitarian crisis in a LMIC, within 5 years of data collection, were included. Publications were double-screened in the title/abstract and full-text stages. We used a machine learning software during the title/abstract screening to increase the efficiency of the process. Measurement tools, sampling and data collection methods, gap areas (geographical, topical and contextual), and indicators were catalogued for easy access in an interactive Tableau dashboard.,Our search yielded 27,197 publications and 2396 non peer-reviewed literature reports. One hundred and seventy publications were included in the final review. Extracted indicators were categorized into seven domains: economic, health, human development, leadership, psychological, security and justice, and sociocultural. The vast majority of studies were observational, and over 70% utilized a cross-sectional study design. Thirty-eight toolkits and questionnaires were identified in this review, of which 19 (50%) were designed specifically for humanitarian settings. Sociocultural was the largest domain in number of studies and indicators in this review, with gender-based violence indicators reported in 66% of studies. Indicators of economic, human development and leadership were uncommon in the peer-reviewed literature.,While there has been some effort to measure GEWE in conflict-affected and other humanitarian settings, measurement has largely focused on violence and security issues.

This widespread adoption of automated systems is accompanied by the increasing concerns regarding their ethical implications. Fundamental rights, such as the ones that require the preservation of privacy, do not discriminate based on sensible attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity, political/sexual orientation), or require one to provide an explanation for a decision, are daily undermined by the use of increasingly complex and less understandable yet more accurate learning algorithms. For this purpose, in this work, we work toward the development of systems able to ensure trustworthiness by delivering privacy, fairness, and explainability by design. In particular, we show that it is possible to simultaneously learn from data while preserving the privacy of the individuals thanks to the use of Homomorphic Encryption, ensuring fairness by learning a fair representation from the data, and ensuring explainable decisions with local and global explanations without compromising the accuracy of the final models. We test our approach on a widespread but still controversial application, namely face recognition, using the recent FairFace dataset to prove the validity of our approach.",Algorithmic Fairness; Homomorphic Encryption; attention maps; deep neural networks; dimensionality reduction; explainable artificial intelligence; learning fair representation; privacy-preserving machine learning; trustworthy artificial intelligence.,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/8/1047,1,1,,,2021,3,0,,Entropy (Basel).,"gender, ethnicity, political/ social orientation, privacy, decision-making scenarios, healthcare, policing, facial recognition",1,White,Italy,4,Università degli Studi di Genova,"BA, PhD candidate",0,1,white,Italy,4,University of Genoa,PhD,0,,"Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy","4,4,4,4",4,4,4,1,1,"University of Genoa, University of Genoa, University of Padua, University of Genoa","BA, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0",UK,117,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Italy,Italy,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white",4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,100%,

While these technological innovations are bound to transform health care, they also bring new ethical concerns to the forefront. One particularly elusive challenge regards discriminatory algorithmic judgements based on biases inherent in the training data. A common line of reasoning distinguishes between justified differential treatments that mirror true disparities between socially salient groups, and unjustified biases which do not, leading to misdiagnosis and erroneous treatment. In the curation of training data this strategy runs into severe problems though, since distinguishing between the two can be next to impossible. We thus plead for a pragmatist dealing with algorithmic bias in healthcare environments. By recurring to a recent reformulation of William James's pragmatist understanding of truth, we recommend that, instead of aiming at a supposedly objective truth, outcome-based therapeutic usefulness should serve as the guiding principle for assessing ML applications in medicine.",Algorithmic bias; Artificial intelligence; Fairness; Machine learning; Philosophy of Science; Pragmatism.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33713239/,1,0,,,2021,10,1,University of Basel,Med Health Care Philos,"machine learning, medicine, socially salient groups, bias, healthcare environments",1,White,Switzerland,4,University of Basel,"BA, PhD candidate",0,0,White,Germany,4,University of Geneva,MD,0,,"Switzerland, Switzerland, Germany","4, 4, 4",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Basel, University of Basel, University of Geneva","BA, PhD, MD","0, 0, 0",Uruguay,1,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Switzerland,Switzerland,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"White, White, White",3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,100%,

We focus on mitigating the harm incurred by a biased machine learning system that offers better outputs (e.g., loans, job interviews) for certain groups than for others. We show that bias in the output can naturally be controlled in probabilistic models by introducing a latent target output. This formulation has several advantages: first, it is a unified framework for several notions of group fairness such as Demographic Parity and Equality of Opportunity; second, it is expressed as a marginalization instead of a constrained problem; and third, it allows the encoding of our knowledge of what unbiased outputs should be. Practically, the second allows us to avoid unstable constrained optimization procedures and to reuse off-the-shelf toolboxes. The latter translates to the ability to control the level of fairness by directly varying fairness target rates. In contrast, existing approaches rely on intermediate, arguably unintuitive, control parameters such as covariance thresholds.","algorithmic bias, fairness, machine learning, demographic parity, equality of opportunity",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.00033/full,1,1,,,2020,7,1,"Nvidia Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc.",Front Artif Intell.,"SEER, bronchioaveolar carcinoma, predictive models, disparity, outcomes, staging, treatment, risk modeling, socioeconomic",1,white,UK,4,University of Sussex,Phd,0,1,asian,Indonesia,2,University of Sussex,PhD,0,,"UK, UK, Indonesia","4, 4, 2",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Sussex, University of Sussex, University of Sussex","PhD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0",Vietnam,1,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UK,UK,Indonesia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, Asian, Asian",1,0,0,2,0,3,3,0,33%,

Physicians incorrectly view people of color as having high pain tolerance, leading to undertreatment. Women with disabilities are often undiagnosed because their symptoms are dismissed. Low-income patients have less access to appropriate treatment. These patterns, and others, reflect long-standing disparities that have become engrained in U.S. health systems. As the healthcare industry adopts artificial intelligence and algorithminformed (AI) tools, it is vital that regulators address healthcare discrimination. AI tools are increasingly used to make both clinical and administrative decisions by hospitals, physicians, and insurers--yet there is no framework that specifically places nondiscrimination obligations on AI users. The Food and Drug Administration has limited authority to regulate AI and has not sought to incorporate anti-discrimination principles in its guidance. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act has not been used to enforce nondiscrimination in healthcare AI and is under-utilized by the Office of Civil Rights. State level protections by medical licensing boards or malpractice liability are similarly untested and have not yet extended nondiscrimination obligations to AI. This Article discusses the role of each legal obligation on healthcare AI and the ways in which each system can improve to address discrimination. It highlights the ways in which industries can self-regulate to set nondiscrimination standards and concludes by recommending standards and creating a super-regulator to address disparate impact by AI. As the world moves towards automation, it is imperative that ongoing concerns about systemic discrimination are removed to prevent further marginalization in healthcare.","Artificial Intelligence / legislation & jurisprudence

We draw on the AI literature, our research on CAD validation and process efficiency, as well as apprehensions of users and stakeholders. Issues of concern included AI accuracy, biased training of AI systems, data privacy, impact on human skill development, transparency and accountability in AI use, as well as intellectual property ownership.

The challenges women face during their career may arise from societal biases and the current scientific culture. We discuss the effect of such biases at three different levels of the career and provide suggestions to tackle them. At the societal level, gender roles can create a negative feedback loop in which women are discouraged from attaining top positions and men are discouraged from choosing a home-centred lifestyle. This loop can be broken early in life by providing children with female role models that have a work-centred life and opening up the discussion about gender roles at a young age. At the level of hiring, unconscious biases can lead to a preference for male candidates. The introduction of (unbiased) artificial intelligence algorithms and gender champions in the hiring process may restore the balance and give men and women an equal chance. At the level of coaching and evaluation, barriers that women face should be addressed on a personal level through the introduction of coaching and mentoring programmes. In addition, women may play a pivotal role in shifting the perception of scientific success away from bibliometric outcomes only towards a more diverse assessment of quality and societal relevance. Taken together, these suggestions may break the glass ceiling in the scientific world for women; create more gender diversity at the top and improve translational science in medicine.",gender; gender champions; gender roles; glass ceiling; translational medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30631765/,1,0,0,4,2018,3,0,0,Frontiers in Medicine,"gender, translational medicine",0,white,the Netherlands,4,University Medical Center Utrecht,Graduate in Global Health,0,0,white,the Netherlands,4,University Medical Center Utrecht,PhD,0,,"Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands, Italy, Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands, USA, South Africa, Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands, Netherlands","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4",16,16,16,1,1,"Utrecht University, Utrecht University, Utrecht University, Diabetes Research Institute IRCCS San Rafaele Scientific Institute, Utrecht University, Utrecht University, Utrecht University, Utrecht University, Utrecht University, Utrecht University,  University of the Witwatersrand, MyOwnMed, HPO Center, Utrecht","PhD, PhD, MD, PhD, BNurs, PhD, PhD, MSSc, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, MBA, PhD",0,Zimbabwe,1,16,16,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,Italy,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,USA,South Africa,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,the Netherlands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white, asian, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white",15,0,0,1,0,16,16,0,94%,

With innovations ranging from 'virtual psychotherapists' to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed.,This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI.,Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions.,From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; 'gaps' in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition.,We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care.

Yet, the complexity of interactions between demographic, social, economic, and geospatial determinants of health hinders incorporating such predictors in existing risk stratification models. We sought to explore a machine-learning-based approach to study the complex interactions between the geospatial and social determinants of health to explain disparities in ACS likelihood in an urban community. This study identified consecutive patients transported by Pittsburgh emergency medical service for a chief complaint of chest pain or ACS-equivalent symptoms. We extracted demographics, clinical data, and location coordinates from electronic health records. Median income was based on US census data by zip code. A random forest (RF) classifier and a regularized logistic regression model were used to identify the most important predictors of ACS likelihood. Our final sample included 2400 patients (age 59 ¬± 17 years, 47% Females, 41% Blacks, 15.8% adjudicated ACS). In our RF model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 ¬± 0.03) age, prior revascularization, income, distance from hospital, and residential neighborhood were the most important predictors of ACS likelihood. In regularized regression (akaike information criterion = 1843, bayesian information criterion = 1912, œá2 = 193, df = 10, p < 0.001), residential neighborhood remained a significant and independent predictor of ACS likelihood. Findings from our study suggest that residential neighborhood constitutes an upstream factor to explain the observed healthcare disparity in ACS risk prediction, independent from known demographic, social, and economic determinants of health, which can inform future work on ACS prevention, in-hospital care, and patient discharge.",acute coronary syndrome; geospatial; social determinants of health.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34820853/,1,1,USA,4,2022,1,1,USA,Res Nurs Health,"health conditions, social-economical risk facotrs, income",1,white,USA,4,University of Pittsburgh,MD,0,1,white,USA,4,University of Pittsburgh,PhD,0,,"Jordan, USA, France, Jordan, USA, USA, Jordan","3, 4, 4,3, 4, 4,3",7,7,7,1,1,"Jordan University of Science and Technology, University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh, ","PhD, RN, MSc, MD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0, 0",Australia,31,7,7,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Jordan,USA,France,Jordan,USA,USA,Jordan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, asian, white, asian, white, white, white",5,0,0,2,0,7,7,0,71%,

However, their current use in clinical practice is marginal and limited to an assistive role to help clinicians in their practices. Safety and efficiency concerns, as well as a general lack of knowledge and experience, may explain this discrepancy between the expected (sometimes futuristic) and current use of virtual characters. An overview of recent evidence would help pinpoint the main concerns and challenges pertaining to their use in mental healthcare. Objective This paper aims to inform relevant actors, including clinicians, on the potential of virtual characters in mental healthcare practices and to raise awareness on societal challenges regarding their use. Method A narrative literature review was conducted to summarize basic and clinical research findings, and to outline an in-depth discussion on various societal caveats related to the inclusion of virtual characters. Results Basic studies highlight several characteristics of the virtual characters that seem to influence patient-clinician interactions. These characteristics can be classified into two categories: perceptual (e.g. realism) and social features (i.e. attribution of social categories such as gender). To this day, many interventions and/or assessments using virtual characters have shown various levels of efficiency in mental health, and certain elements of a therapeutic relationship (e.g. alliance and empathy) may even be triggered during an interaction with a virtual character. To develop and increase the use of virtual characters, numerous socioeconomic and ethical issues must be examined. Although the accessibility and the availability of virtual characters are an undeniable advantage for their use in mental healthcare, some inequities about their application remain. In addition, the accumulation of biometric data (e.g. heart rate) could provide valuable information to clinicians and could help develop autonomous virtual characters, which raises concerns over issues of security and privacy. This paper proposes some recommendations to avoid such undesirable outcomes. Conclusion Due to their promising features, the inclusion of virtual characters will no doubt be increasingly prevalent in mental healthcare services. All involved actors should thus be informed about specific challenges raised by such breakthroughs. They should also actively participate in discussions regarding the development of virtual characters in order to adopt unified recommendations for their safe and ethical use in mental healthcare.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34597488/,1,0,Canada,4,2021,2,0,,Sante Ment Que,"mental healthcare, artificial intelligence, virtual characters",0,white,Canada,4,Université Laval,MD,0,1,white,Canada,4,Université Laval,Ms,0,,"Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada","4, 4, 4,4,4",5,5,5,1,1,"Université Laval, Université Laval, Université Laval","MsArts, unknown, unknown","0, 0, 0",Puerto Rico,2,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white, white",5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,100%,

Gender-based differences in mental health are well established. The objective of this study was to evaluate a new data mining technique to identify social locations of young Canadians where differences in mental health between adolescent males and females were most pronounced.,We examined reports from 21,221 young Canadians aged 11-15 years (10,349 males, 10,872 females) who had responded to a 2018 national health and health behaviours survey. Using recursive partitioning for subgroup identification (SIDES), we identified social locations that were associated with the strongest differences between males and females for three reported mental health outcomes: positive psychosomatic health, symptoms of depression, and having a diagnosed mental illness.,The SIDES algorithm identified both established and new intersections of social factors that were associated with gender-based differences in mental health experiences, most favouring males.,This analysis represents a novel proof-of-concept to demonstrate the utility of a subgroup identification algorithm to reveal important differences in mental health experiences between adolescent males and females. The algorithm detected new social locations (i.e., where gender intersected with other characteristics) associated with poor mental health outcomes. These findings set the stage for further intersectional research, involving both quantitative and qualitative analyses, to explore how axes of discrimination may intersect to shape potential gender-based health inequalities that emerge during childhood.","['adolescence', 'adolescent', 'algorithm', 'article', 'Canadian', 'child', 'controlled study', 'data mining', 'depression', 'female', 'health behavior', 'health care quality', 'health survey', 'human', 'male', 'mental health', 'personal experience', 'psychosomatics', 'sex difference', 'social aspect', 'social determinants of health', 'Subgroup Identification based on Differential Effect Search algorithm', 'symptom']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100946,1,1,Canada,4,2021,1,0,,SSM Popul Health,"Adolescence, Epidemiology, Mental health, Social determinants",1,white,Canada,4,University oof Prince Edwards,PhD,0,1,white,Canada,4,Queen's University,PhD,0,,"Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4",9,9,9,1,1,"University of Ottawa, Queen's University, Brock University, University of Ottawa, Queen's University, Queen's University, Queen's University","MD, MD, DMin, PhD, PhD, PhD, MS","0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0",,0,9,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white",9,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,100%,

ICD codes in EHRs for SDOH identification, therefore, may under-report patients with social needs and risks, which makes it difficult for healthcare systems to target ""high risk"" patients for interventions addressing social needs. SDOH may be discussed with healthcare providers during visits and, therefore, recorded in EHR free-text notes (a.k.a, providers' notes). These notes might provide a more accurate accounting of SDOH; however, traditional approaches for review and abstraction of patient information from medical record notes is laborious, expensive, and slow. Recent developments in text mining and natural language processing (NLP) of digitized text allows for reliable, low cost, and rapid extraction of information from EHRs. In this pilot project we evaluated whether an NLP algorithm could extract valid measures of SDOH from Epic-based EHRs in three healthcare systems: Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS), Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS), and KP Southern California (KPSCcal). The focus of our study was residential instability (i.e., homelessness and housing insecurity). Study Design: The study was conducted independently, in a parallel and coordinated framework across sites. The validation assessment and NLP algorithm logic were identical across sites; however, the ""gold standard"" for assessment of algorithm validity differed according to data availability. Using the EntityRuler module of spaCy 2.3 Python toolkit, we created a rule-based NLP system made up of 61 expert-developed patterns that, if present, would represent residential instability. Our patterns included word 'lemmas' and base forms to account for morphological variations (e.g., singular and plural forms) as well as substitutions of different prepositions (e.g., about and for), and synonym words (e.g., house, apartment, and home). We calibrated and then validated the algorithm using a split sample approach. Validity was assessed at each site by measures of sensitivity and specificity. Population Studied: Beneficiaries >18 years of age during 2016 through 2019 who received care at JHHS, KPMAS, KPSCal. Principal Findings: The following table presents the characteristics of the study population and performance of the NLP algorithm at each study site. Conclusions: The consistent performance of this NLP algorithm to identify residential instability in three different healthcare systems suggests the algorithm is generalizable. The consistent and relatively high sensitivity and specificity demonstrates the algorithm's validity. Implications for Policy or Practice: Development of generalizable NLP algorithms with promising performance will enhance the value of EHRs to identify at risk patients across different health systems, to improve patient care and outcomes, and to mitigate socioeconomic disparities across individuals and communities.","['adult', 'algorithm', 'California', 'conference abstract', 'data availability', 'electronic health record', 'female', 'gold standard', 'health care system', 'homelessness', 'housing', 'human', 'logic', 'male', 'mining', 'natural language processing', 'patient care', 'patient information', 'pilot study', 'risk assessment', 'sensitivity and specificity', 'social determinants of health', 'validity']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13756,1,1,USA,4,2021,0,1,USA,Health Services Research,"eletronic medical records, social demographics, residential instability, homelessness, home insecurity",0,asian,Iran,4,Johns Hopkins,MD,0,1,white,USA,4,Kaiser Permanente,PhD,0,,"Iran, Italy, USA, China, USA, USA, USA, Jordan, USA","2, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4",9,9,9,1,1,"University of Florida, Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente, UC Irvine, Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente, Johns Hopkins","PhD, MD, PhD, MD, LVN, MPH, PhD","1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0",,0,9,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Iran,Italy,USA,China,USA,USA,USA,Jordan,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, white, asian,hispanic, -, white, asian, white",3,0,1,4,1,9,9,0,33%,

Unfortunately, many people do not have healthcare coverage and much research is needed to identify the factors leading to this phenomenon. Hence, the goal of this study is to examine the healthcare coverage of individuals by applying popular analytic techniques on a wide-variety of predictive factors. A large and feature-rich dataset is used in conjunction with four popular data mining techniques-artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines and logistic regression-to develop prediction models. Applying sensitivity analysis to the developed prediction models, the ranked importance of variables is determined. The experimental results indicated that the most accurate classifier for this phenomenon was the support vector machines that had an overall classification accuracy of 82.23% on the 10-fold holdout/test sample. The most important predictive factors came out as income, employment status, education, and marital status. The ability to identify and explain the reasoning of those likely to be without healthcare coverage through the application of accurate classification models can potentially be used in reducing the disparity in health care coverage.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23823421/,1,1,USA,4,2013,1,0,,Stud Health Technol Inform,"Healthcare inequalities, income, employment status, education, and marital status",1,white,USA,4,Oklahoma State University,PhD,1,0,white,USA,4,Oklahoma State University,PhD,1,,"USA, USA","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,"Oklahoma State University, Oklahoma State University","Phd, Phd","1,1",,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white']",2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,100%,

Asthma prevalence is higher among African Americans (11.2%) compared to European Americans (7.7%). Bronchodilator medications are part of the first-line therapy, and the rescue medication, for acute asthma symptoms. Bronchodilator drug response (BDR) varies substantially among different racial/ethnic groups. Asthma prevalence in African Americans is only 3.5% higher than that of European Americans, however, asthma mortality among African Americans is four times that of European Americans; variation in BDR may play an important role in explaining this health disparity. To improve our understanding of disparate health outcomes in complex phenotypes such as BDR, it is important to consider interactions between environmental and biological variables. Results: We evaluated the impact of pairwise and three-variable interactions between environmental, social, and biological variables on BDR in 233 African American youth with asthma using Visualization of Statistical Epistasis Networks (ViSEN). ViSEN is a non-parametric entropy-based approach able to quantify interaction effects using an information-theory metric known as Information Gain (IG). We performed analyses in the full dataset and in sex-stratified subsets. Our analyses identified several interaction models significantly, and suggestively, associated with BDR. The strongest interaction significantly associated with BDR was a pairwise interaction between pre-natal smoke exposure and socioeconomic status (full dataset IG: 2.78%, p = 0.001; female IG: 7.27%, p = 0.004)). Sex-stratified analyses yielded divergent results for females and males, indicating the presence of sex-specific effects. Conclusions: Our study identified novel interaction effects significantly, and suggestively, associated with BDR in African American children with asthma. Notably, we found that all of the interactions identified by ViSEN were ""pure""interaction effects, in that they were not the result of strong main effects on BDR, highlighting the complexity of the network of biological and environmental factors impacting this phenotype. Several associations uncovered by ViSEN would not have been detected using regression-based methods, thus emphasizing the importance of employing statistical methods optimized to detect both additive and non-additive interaction effects when studying complex phenotypes such as BDR. The information gained in this study increases our understanding and appreciation of the complex nature of the interactions between environmental and health-related factors that influence BDR and will be invaluable to biomedical researchers designing future studies.","['bronchodilating agent', 'adolescent', 'adult', 'African American', 'air pollution', 'article', 'asthma', 'case control study', 'child', 'clinical outcome', 'controlled study', 'drug response', 'environmental factor', 'environmental impact', 'European American', 'experience of discrimination', 'female', 'health disparity', 'human', 'information gain', 'information processing', 'information system', 'major clinical study', 'male', 'mortality rate', 'phenotype', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevalence', 'priority journal', 'process optimization', 'race difference', 'smoke', 'social aspect', 'social discrimination', 'social status', 'Visualization of Statistical Epistasis Network']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13040-020-00218-7,1,1,USA,4,2020,3,1,USA,BioData Mining,"Asthma, race, ethnicity, pulmonology, mortality",1,hispanic,USA,4,UCSF,MD,1,0,white,USA,4,UCSF,MBA,1,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4",18,18,18,1,1,"UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, Stanford, Thomas Jefferson University, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF, UCSF,","MS, PhD, MD, PhD, MD, PhD, MS, PhD, MD, MD, PhD, MD, MD, MS, MD,","1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1",,0,18,18,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['hispanic', 'hispanic', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'asian', 'asian', 'hispanic', 'white', 'white', 'asian', 'asian', 'hispanic', 'white', 'asian', 'white', white']",9,0,4,5,0,18,18,0,50%,

Mobility provides freedom to patients to obtain health care from providers across regions and even countries. It is essential to monitor patient choices in order to maintain the quality standards and responsiveness of the health system, otherwise, the health system may suffer from geographic disparities in the accessibility to quality and responsive health care. In this article, we study patient mobility in a national health care system to identify medical regions, spatio-temporal and service characteristics of health care utilization, and demands for patient mobility.,We conducted a systematic analysis of province-to-province patient mobility in Turkey from December 2009 to December 2013, which was derived from 1.2 billion health service records. We first used a flow-based regionalization method to discover functional medical regions from the patient mobility network. We compare the results of data-driven regions to designated regions of the government in order to identify the areas of mismatch between planned regional service delivery and the observed utilization in the form of patient flows. Second, we used feature selection, and multivariate flow clustering to identify spatio-temporal characteristics and health care needs of patients on the move.,Medical regions we derived by analyzing the patient mobility data showed strong overlap with the designated regions of the Ministry of Health. We also identified a number of regions that the regional service utilization did not match the planned service delivery. Overall, our spatio-temporal and multivariate analysis of regional and long-distance patient flows revealed strong relationship with socio-demographic and cultural structure of the society and migration patterns. Also, patient flows exhibited seasonal patterns, and yearly trends which correlate with implemented policies throughout the period. We found that policies resulted in different outcomes across the country. We also identified characteristics of long-distance flows which could help inform policy-making by assessing the needs of patients in terms of medical specialization, service level and type.,Our approach helped identify (1) the mismatch between regional policy and practice in health care utilization (2) spatial, temporal, health service level characteristics and medical specialties that patients seek out by traveling longer distances. Our findings can help identify the imbalance between supply and demand, changes in mobility behaviors, and inform policy-making with insights.",,https://www.google.com/search?q=analysis+of+big+patient+mobility+data+for+identifying+medical+regions%2C+spatio-temporal+characteristics+and+care+demands+of+patients+on+the+move&rlz=1C5CHFA_enMT1017MT1017&oq=analysis+of+big+patient+mobility+data+for+identifying+medical+regions%2C+spatio-temporal+characteristics+and+care+demands+of+patients+on+the+move&aqs=chrome..69i57.269j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,1,1,USA,4,2018,17,0,,Int J of Env Research/Public Health,"Flow mapping, health care, patient mobilty, regionalization, spatial data mining",1,asian,Turkey,4,Istanbul Technical University,PhD,0,1,asian,USA,4,University of South Carolina,PhD,0,,"Turkey, Turkey, USA, USA","3,3,4,4",4,4,4,1,1,"Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul Technical University, University of Iowa, University of South Carolina ","PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Turkey,Turkey,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, asian, asian",0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0%,

Mining of social media discussions about clinical trials has been used previously to identify patient barriers to enrollment in clinical trials; however, a comprehensive breakdown of sentiments and barriers by various racial and ethnic groups is lacking.,The aim of this study is to use an innovative methodology to analyze web-based conversations about cancer clinical trials and to identify and compare conversation topics, barriers, and sentiments between different racial and ethnic populations.,We analyzed 372,283 web-based conversations about cancer clinical trials, of which 179,339 (48.17%) of the discussions had identifiable race information about the individual posting the conversations. Using sophisticated machine learning software and analyses, we were able to identify key sentiments and feelings, topics of interest, and barriers to clinical trials across racial groups. The stage of treatment could also be identified in many of the discussions, allowing for a unique insight into how the sentiments and challenges of patients change throughout the treatment process for each racial group.,We observed that only 4.01% (372,283/9,284,284) of cancer-related discussions referenced clinical trials. Within these discussions, topics of interest and identified clinical trial barriers discussed by all racial and ethnic groups throughout the treatment process included health care professional interactions, cost of care, fear, anxiety and lack of awareness, risks, treatment experiences, and the clinical trial enrollment process. Health care professional interactions, cost of care, and enrollment processes were notably discussed more frequently in minority populations. Other minor variations in the frequency of discussion topics between ethnic and racial groups throughout the treatment process were identified.,This study demonstrates the power of digital search technology in health care research. The results are also valuable for identifying the ideal content and timing for the delivery of clinical trial information and resources for different racial and ethnic groups.","['African American', 'American', 'anxiety', 'article', 'Asian', 'attitude to health', 'awareness', 'Caucasian', 'clinical trial (topic)', 'conversation', 'data analysis software', 'data extraction', 'data mining', 'digital technology', 'experience', 'fear', 'health care cost', 'health care personnel', 'human', 'machine learning', 'malignant neoplasm']",http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25621,1,1,USA,4,2021,0,0,,J Med Int Cancer,"Cancer, clinical trials, data mining, health care disparities, health communication, natural language processing, race and ethnicity, social media, text extraction",0,hispanic,Puerto Rico,4,Mayo Clinic College of Medicine,MD,0,0,asian,USA,4,Rutgers University,PhD,1,,"Puerto Rico, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",10,10,10,1,1,"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, John Hopkins, Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Southern California, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Penn State University, Vanderbilt University, Zucker School of Medicine, Rutgers University ","MD, MD, MD, PhD, PhD, PhD, MBBS, PhD, MD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1",,0,10,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Puerto Rico,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"hispanic, white, white, black, black, white, black, black, white, asian",4,4,1,1,0,10,10,0,40%,

There are several vaccines that protect against strains of HPV most associated with cervical and other cancers. Thus, HPV vaccination has become an important component of adolescent preventive health care. As media evolves, more information about HPV vaccination is shifting to social media platforms such as Twitter. Health information consumed on social media may be especially influential for segments of society such as younger populations, as well as ethnic and racial minorities.,The objectives of our study were to quantify HPV vaccine communication on Twitter, and to develop a novel methodology to improve the collection and analysis of Twitter data.,We collected Twitter data using 10 keywords related to HPV vaccination from August 1, 2014 to July 31, 2015. Prospective data collection used the Twitter Search API and retrospective data collection used Twitter Firehose. Using a codebook to characterize tweet sentiment and content, we coded a subsample of tweets by hand to develop classification models to code the entire sample using machine learning procedures. We also documented the words in the 140-character tweet text most associated with each keyword. We used chi-square tests, analysis of variance, and nonparametric equality of medians to test for significant differences in tweet characteristic by sentiment.,A total of 193,379 English-language tweets were collected, classified, and analyzed. Associated words varied with each keyword, with more positive and preventive words associated with ""HPV vaccine"" and more negative words associated with name-brand vaccines. Positive sentiment was the largest type of sentiment in the sample, with 75,393 positive tweets (38.99% of the sample), followed by negative sentiment with 48,940 tweets (25.31% of the sample). Positive and neutral tweets constituted the largest percentage of tweets mentioning prevention or protection (20,425/75,393, 27.09% and 6477/25,110, 25.79%, respectively), compared with only 11.5% of negative tweets (5647/48,940; P<.001). Nearly one-half (22,726/48,940, 46.44%) of negative tweets mentioned side effects, compared with only 17.14% (12,921/75,393) of positive tweets and 15.08% of neutral tweets (3787/25,110; P<.001).,Examining social media to detect health trends, as well as to communicate important health information, is a growing area of research in public health. Understanding the content and implications of conversations that form around HPV vaccination on social media can aid health organizations and health-focused Twitter users in creating a meaningful exchange of ideas and in having a significant impact on vaccine uptake. This area of research is inherently interdisciplinary, and this study supports this movement by applying public health, health communication, and data science approaches to extend methodologies across fields.",HPV vaccine; Twitter; communication methods; content analysis; data mining.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27919863/,1,1,USA,4,2016,110,0,,J Med Internet Res,HPV vaccine; Twitter; communication methods; content analysis; data mining,1,white,USA,4,Drexel University,PhD,0,0,white,USA,4,Drexel University,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, Israel, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",6,6,6,1,1,"Drexel University, Thomas Jefferson University, Microsoft Research, Drexel University, Drexel University, Drexel University","PhD, DrPH, PhD, DrPH, MEd","0, 0, 0, 0",,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,Israel,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white, white, white",6,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,100%,

While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs.

The aim of countless careers has been to build intelligent machines that can interpret the world as humans do, understand language, and learn from real-world examples. In the early part of this century, two events coincided that transformed the field of AI. The advent of widely available Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) meant that parallel processing was faster, cheaper, and more powerful. At the same time, the era of ‘Big Data’ – images, text, bioinformatics, medical records, and financial transactions, among others – was moving firmly into the mainstream, along with almost limitless data storage. These factors led to a dramatic resurgence in interest in AI in both academic circles and industries outside traditional computer science. Once again, AI occupies the zeitgeist, and is poised to transform medicine at a basic science, clinical, healthcare management, and financial level.
Terminology surrounding these technologies continues to evolve and can be a source of confusion for non-computer scientists. AI is broadly classified as: general AI, machines that replicate human thought, emotion, and reason (and remain, for now, in the realm of science fiction); and narrow AI, technologies that can perform specific tasks as well as, or better than, humans. Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can learn complex relationships or patterns from empirical data and make accurate decisions.2 Rather than coding specific sets of instructions to accomplish a task, the machine is ‘trained’ using large amounts of data and algorithms that confer it the ability to learn how to perform the task. Unlike normal algorithms, it is the data that ‘tells’ the machine what the ‘good answer’ is, and learning occurs without explicit programming. ML problems can be classified as supervised learning or unsupervised learning.3 In a supervised machine learning algorithm, such as face recognition, the machine is shown several examples of ‘face’ or ‘non-face’ and the algorithm learns to predict whether an unseen image is a face or not. In unsupervised learning, the images shown to the machine are not labelled as ‘face’ or ‘non-face’.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)4 are one group of algorithms used for machine learning. While ANNs have existed for over 60 years, they fell out of favour during the 1990s and 2000s. In the last half-decade, ANNs have had a resurgence under a new name: deep artificial networks (or ‘Deep Learning’). ANNs are uniquely poised to take full advantage of the computational boost offered by GPUs, allowing them to crunch through data sets of enormous sizes. These range from computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, face recognition, and optical character recognition (OCR), to natural language processing and even game-playing problems (from mastering simple Atari games to the recent AlphaGo victory against human grandmasters).5
ANNs work by constructing layers upon layers of simple processing units (often referred to as ‘neurons’), interconnected via many differentially weighted connections. ANNs are ‘trained’ by using backpropagation algorithms, essentially telling the machine how to alter the internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. As such, deep learning can be largely automatic once set in motion, learning intricate patterns from even high-dimensional raw data with little guidance6 and continuously improving.
How might machine learning and deep learning transform the current medical, and specifically the musculoskeletal, landscape? Search engines, spam filters, voice recognition software, and autonomous driving vehicles all depend on ML technologies and are now part of our daily lives, irrespective of the industry sector we occupy. Medicine seems particularly amenable to ML solutions and has been the focus of much interest in thriving technological economies, such as Silicon Valley.
The impact of AI can be considered in two main themes: first, extracting meaning from ‘Big Data’ in the research domain; and second, aiding clinicians in delivering care to patients.4 Using machine learning to extract information on treatment patterns and diagnoses has already been used in large digital databases of Electronic Health Records in the United Kingdom, and has enabled data-driven prediction of drug effects and interactions, identification of type 2 diabetes subgroups, and discovery of comorbidity clusters in autism spectrum disorders.7
In the United States, the IBM Watson Health cognitive computing system (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York) has used machine learning approaches to create a decision support system for physicians treating cancer patients, with the intention of improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing costs using large volumes of patient cases and over one million scholarly articles.
Within musculoskeletal medicine, machine learning and active shape modelling have proven influential in understanding biomechanics, orthopaedic implant design,8 bone tumour resection,9 prediction of progression of osteoarthritis based on anatomical shape assessment,10,11 and robotic surgery.12 The analysis of complex physiological data via ML has been used in patients with spinal degenerative changes. Hayashi et al13 focused on gait analysis as a classification method to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with multilevel spinal stenosis. By identifying gait characteristics of those with confirmed L4 or L5 radiculopathy, support vector machine (SVM) analysis was used to contrast patient motion with normal controls, allowing the development of a gait model to aid diagnosis. Similar work has been done with knee osteoarthritis, using ML to analyze massive data inputs from complex gait analysis to develop models that provide an estimation of the presence of disease.14 This engineering approach to a medical diagnostic problem is not isolated. In the lower limb, deformable joint contact models can be used to estimate loading conditions for cartilage-cartilage, implant-implant, human-orthotic, and foot-ground interactions. However, contact evaluations are often so expensive computationally that they can be prohibitive for simulations or optimizations requiring thousands or even millions of contact evaluations. Eskenazi et al15 created an ANN-based contact model of the tibiofemoral joint using over 75 000 evaluations of a fine-grid elastic foundation (EF) contact model. The contact model computed contact forces and torques about 1000 times faster than a less accurate coarse grid EF contact model, removing an important computational bottleneck from musculoskeletal simulations incorporating deformable joint contact models. Similar approaches have been used in the analysis of preoperative images to help the surgeon define intraoperative bone resection levels in upper limb arthroplasty.16
Major improvements have been seen in all stages of the medical imaging pathway, from acquisition and reconstruction to analysis and interpretation. Segmentation, the division of digitized images into homogeneous partitions with respect to specific borders of regions of interest, is commonly used in the assessment of cartilage lesions. Traditionally performed manually, it is a difficult and time-consuming task with limited standardization. Fully automated ML analysis segmentation of hip, knee, and wrist cartilage MRI images17 have transformed this process and promise to bring automated segmentation into the mainstream of research and clinical practice. Complex, user-dependent image analysis techniques, such as ultrasound for developmental dysplasia of the hip, are particularly amenable to deep learning techniques.18 Individuals in geographically underserved or remote locations can be imaged by unskilled users, accurately diagnosed, and then directed to expert care at an earlier stage in the natural history of disease, potentially transforming outcomes.
As both the number of imaging studies and the number of images per study grows, radiology has become threatened by its own success: the workload of radiologists has increased dramatically, the number of radiologists is limited, and healthcare costs related to imaging continue to increase. With 40 million mammograms and 38 million MRI scans19 performed each year in the United States alone, and a trend to extend the indications for scans containing huge amounts of data,20 ML has and will continue to have an important role to play in image interpretation. Several studies have suggested that the incorporation of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems into the diagnostic process can improve the performance of image interpretation by providing quantitative support for clinical decision-making, particularly the differentiation of malignant and benign tumours.21 CADe provides an effective way to reduce reading time, increase detection sensitivity, and improve diagnosis accuracy, thus supporting rather than usurping the need for specialist musculoskeletal radiologists. In the future, these technologies may progress from clinical decision support use to diagnostic decision-making (computer-aided diagnosis (CADx)). Currently, regulatory bodies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration do not permit this, and it is unlikely that doctor’s representative groups will embrace it enthusiastically either. However, as the accuracy and speed of the technology increases, clinicians should consider their role in repetitive manual tasks that involve pattern recognition and reporting, and understand how they can incorporate technology into their practice rather than resist it.
Not all commentators share unbridled enthusiasm for adoption of AI technologies. Professor Stephen Hawking, in 2016 declared AI to be “either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity”.22 The Royal Society, in an attempt to address public concern on the topic, commissioned a report on AI and specifically on Machine Learning. While championing the role of the technology in the management of Big Data, it also highlighted legitimate anxiety regarding the implications for governance of data, as well as the role of AI in automation, and subsequently the future of work and employment.23 What does the future hold for clinicians and researchers as ML and DL technologies advance? Data will continue to increase and there can be little doubt that machine learning will be integral to interpretation and utilization. While it is easy to consider medicine a rational, evidence-based activity focused on well-defined conditions, in reality it is ambiguous and emphasizes relationships, advice, and reassurance. So, while medicine is much more than simply a diagnosis and treatment algorithm, machine learning looks set to both transform and complement the way we deliver care.",Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Artificial Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1302%2F2046-3758.73.bjr-2017-0147.r1,1,0,USA,4,2018,23,0,,Bone Joint Research: https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/journal/bj360,"Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence",1,white,USA,4,Stanford University,MD,0,1,white,UK,4,Queen Mary University of London,MBBS,0,,"USA, United Kingdom, United Kingdom, United Kingdom","4,4,4,4",4,4,4,1,1,"Stanford, Royal London Hospital, Royal London Hospital,  Royal London Hospital","MD, MBBS, MBBS, MBBS","0, 0 , 0, 0",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,UK,UK,UK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white ",4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,100%,

Methods: We used repeated measures of individual and neighborhood-level SDOH data from CARDIA participants (ppts) to understand how SDOH change from ages 18-44 years. There were 48 diverse SDOH exposures measured. Using a novel, machine learning, sequential pattern mining method (Subgraph Augmented Non-negative Matrix Factorization), we identified clusters of time-dependent SDOH variables occurring in 5% or more of ppts. Clusters were then used as independent variables in logistic regression models to assess associations with CVH at age ‚â•45 years. CVH status was defined using the AHA's Simple 7 metrics on diet, physical activity, smoking, BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose, and summarized by a 14-point score (poor 0-7, moderate 8-11, high 12-14 points). We tested associations of clusters with the outcome of poor CVH at age ‚â•45 years, and identified the characteristics of significant SDOH clusters. Results: There were 3,522 ppts included (46.3% Black, 55.9% women; mean age 25.3 years atbaseline). Mean CVH score (out of 14) was 10.4 ¬± 1.8 points at baseline and 8.9 ¬± 2.3 points at age‚â•45 years; 483 ppts (13.7%) had high, 2026 (57.5%) had moderate, and 1013 (28.8%) had poorCVH in middle age. The best performing logistic model included 4 SDOH trend clusters (Table).SDOH Clusters 1, 2, and 3 were each associated with significant 50-80% lower odds of having poorCVH in middle age, whereas Cluster 4 was associated with 2.5-fold higher odds of poor CVH. Themost informative variables over time comprising each SDOH cluster are also shown in the Table. Conclusions: Specific SDOH clusters through young adulthood are significantly associated with reaching mid-life with poor CVH status. Components of these SDOH clusters may be potentialtargets for social interventions and policies to improve CVH.","['cholesterol', 'adult', 'adulthood', 'blood pressure', 'body mass', 'cardia', 'conference abstract', 'controlled study', 'coronary artery', 'diet', 'female', 'glucose blood level', 'human', 'independent variable', 'machine learning', 'major clinical study', 'male', 'middle aged', 'mining', 'neighborhood', 'non-negative matrix factorization', 'physical activity', 'smoking', 'social determinants of health', 'young adult']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/circ.143.suppl_1.MP18,1,1,USA,4,2021,0,0,,American Heart Association: Circulation,"Longitudinal Social Determinants, young adulthood, cardiovascular health, Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults",0,white,USA,4,Northwestern University,Phd,0,1,white,USA,4,North Western ,MD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, China, USA","4,4,4,3,4",5,5,5,1,1,"North Western, North Western, North Western, North Western, North Western","PhD, PhD, PhD, ScD, MD","0, 0, 0 ,0,0",,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,China,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white, white, white",5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,100%,

However, SES data are rarely included in genetic studies due in part to the difficultly of collecting these data when studies were not originally designed for that purpose. The emergence of large clinic-based biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) provides research access to large patient populations with longitudinal phenotype data captured in structured fields as billing codes, procedure codes, and prescriptions. SES data however, are often not explicitly recorded in structured fields, but rather recorded in the free text of clinical notes and communications. The content and completeness of these data vary widely by practitioner. To enable gene-environment studies that consider SES as an exposure, we sought to extract SES variables from racial/ethnic minority adult patients (n=9,977) in BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center biorepository linked to de-identified EHRs. We developed several measures of SES using information available within the de-identified EHR, including broad categories of occupation, education, insurance status, and homelessness. Two hundred patients were randomly selected for manual review to develop a set of seven algorithms for extracting SES information from de-identified EHRs. The algorithms consist of 15 categories of information, with 830 unique search terms. SES data extracted from manual review of 50 randomly selected records were compared to data produced by the algorithm, resulting in positive predictive values of 80.0% (education), 85.4% (occupation), 87.5% (unemployment), 63.6% (retirement), 23.1% (uninsured), 81.8% (Medicaid), and 33.3% (homelessness), suggesting some categories of SES data are easier to extract in this EHR than others. The SES data extraction approach developed here will enable future EHR-based genetic studies to integrate SES information into statistical analyses. Ultimately, incorporation of measures of SES into genetic studies will help elucidate the impact of the social environment on disease risk and outcomes.","['algorithm', 'biology', 'data mining', 'electronic health record', 'evaluation study', 'female', 'health status', 'human', 'male', 'procedures', 'social class', 'statistics and numerical data']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896978/,1,1,USA,4,2017,24,1,"NIH, National Center for Research Resources, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences",World Scientific https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/epdf/10.1142/9789813207813_0023,Text mining algorithms,0,white,USA,4,Vanderbilt,PhD,0,0,white,USA,4,"University of California, San Diego",PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4",6,6,6,1,1,"Vanderbilt University, Case Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, University of California, San Diego","PhD, PhD, BS, PhD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0",,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",6,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,100%,

Digital tools, such as social media, data mining, email or text-messaging, could improve recruitment or retention, but an overview of this research area is lacking. We aimed to systematically map the characteristics of digital recruitment and retention tools for RCTs, and the features of the comparative studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of these tools during the past 10 years.,We searched Medline, Embase, other databases, the Internet, and relevant web sites in July 2018 to identify comparative studies of digital tools for recruiting and/or retaining participants in health RCTs. Two reviewers independently screened references against protocol-specified eligibility criteria. Included studies were coded by one reviewer with 20% checked by a second reviewer, using pre-defined keywords to describe characteristics of the studies, populations and digital tools evaluated.,We identified 9163 potentially relevant references, of which 104 articles reporting 105 comparative studies were included in the systematic map. The number of published studies on digital tools has doubled in the past decade, but most studies evaluated digital tools for recruitment rather than retention. The key health areas investigated were health promotion, cancers, circulatory system diseases and mental health. Few studies focussed on minority or under-served populations, and most studies were observational. The most frequently-studied digital tools were social media, Internet sites, email and tv/radio for recruitment; and email and text-messaging for retention. One quarter of the studies measured efficiency (cost per recruited or retained participant) but few studies have evaluated people's attitudes towards the use of digital tools.,This systematic map highlights a number of evidence gaps and may help stakeholders to identify and prioritise further research needs. In particular, there is a need for rigorous research on the efficiency of the digital tools and their impact on RCT participants and investigators, perhaps as studies-within-a-trial (SWAT) research.

We examined how risk factors for long-term health outcomes for Estrogen positive breast cancer patients differed by county economic status in southern Appalachia.,Data was collected through retrospective data mining of patient medical files (N = 238). Using the self-reported zipcode, patients were classified into county economic status. At-risk and distressed designations were also rural counties. Bi-variate statistical analyses were used to evaluate how demographic, behavioral, health risk factors differed across economic statuses.,For demographic factors, fewer single individuals lived in at-risk counties and older individuals lived in distressed counties. For health behaviors, more individuals in transitional counties report drinking alcohol but more individuals in distressed counties reported adhering to medication. For morbidity, more individuals in distressed counties reported having diabetes or a circulatory disease.,Many risk factors differed across county economic statuses. Therefore, doctors must consider the patient's context as a risk factor not just their individual characteristics. Patients from economically distressed counties may be at higher risk for treatment complications due to a larger proportion of co-morbidities and older age. Because many risk factors (eg, previous cancer, BMI) are similarly proportioned across Appalachian economic statuses, ER+ breast cancer patients in Appalachia may be at a similarly high risk for health complications compared to the rest of the country.","Breast cancer, Appalachia, economic status",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30928901/,1,1,USA,4,2019,2,0,,Cancer Treatment and Research Communications https://www-clinicalkey-com.meharry.idm.oclc.org/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S2468294218300698?returnurl=null&referrer=null,"Economic disparities, Appalachia, long-term health, estrogen positive breast cancer patients",0,white,USA,4,"University of California, Davis",PhD,1,1,white,USA,4,University of California Davis,MD,1,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4",6,6,6,1,1," University of California Davis,  University of California Davis,  University of California Davis,  University of California Davis,  University of California Davis","PhD, MBA, MD, MD, PhD, MD","1, 1, 1, 1, 1",,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",6,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,100%,

Natural language processing (NLP) uses computer-based algorithms not traditionally implemented in community psychology to effectively and efficiently process text. These methods include examining the frequency of words and phrases, the clustering of topics, and the interrelationships of words. This article applied NLP to explore the concept of equity in community psychology. The COVID-19 crisis has made pre-existing health equity gaps even more salient. Community psychology has a specific interest in working with organizations, systems, and communities to address social determinants that perpetuate inequities by refocusing interventions around achieving health and wellness for all. This article examines how community psychology has discussed equity thus far to identify strengths and gaps for future research and practice. The results showed the prominence of community-based participatory research and the diversity of settings researchers work in. However, the total number of abstracts with equity concepts was lower than expected, which suggests there is a need for a continued focus on equity.","['health equity', 'human', 'knowledge discovery', 'natural language processing', 'participatory research', 'procedures', 'publication', 'social determinants of health', 'social psychiatry']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22603,1,1,USA,4,2021,0,0,,Journal of community psycology https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.meharry.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1002/jcop.22603,"equity,  community psychology, natural language processing",1,white,USA,4,Dawn Chorus Group,PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,Dawn Chorus Group,PhD,0,,USA,4,1,1,1,1,1,Dawn Chorus Group,PhD,0,,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['white'],1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,100%,

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we provide our definition of explainability and show how it can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.

Much research has been conducted on the factors that influence service use in this population, but the methods generally used cannot easily identify the complex interactions that are thought to exist. In this paper, we examine predictors of subsequent service use among respondents to a population health survey who met criteria for a past-year mood, anxiety or substance-related disorder.,To determine service use, we use an administrative database including all physician consultations in the period of interest. To identify predictors, we use classification tree (CART) analysis, a data mining technique with the ability to identify unsuspected interactions. We compare results to those from logistic regression models.,We identify 1213 individuals with past-year disorder. In the year after the survey, 24% (n=312) of these had a mental health-related physician consultation. Logistic regression revealed that age, sex and marital status predicted service use.

In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient-doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.

But even though cancer mortality has declined overall in intervening years after the NCA, cancer health disparities persist in the form of higher cancer incidence and mortality rates among certain cancer types and certain populations. Breast and cervical cancers disproportionately affect African American, Hispanic, and American Indian Women. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death for Latinos (with men and women combined). Forty-five years after the NCA, how will the next enormous cancer initiatives‚ÄîPresident Barack Obama‚Äôs Cancer Moonshot and the All of Us Research Program (formerly the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program)‚Äîimpact cancer health disparities? The emergence of precision medicine and the sharing of information across sectors are at the heart of these large national initiatives and hold vast potential to address complex health disparities that remain in incidence reporting, incidence, treatment, prognoses, and mortality among certain cancer types and racial/ethnic minorities, including African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos, compared to Whites. But clinical research efforts and data collection have historically lacked diverse representation for various reasons, posing a large risk to these national initiatives in their ability to develop diverse cohorts that adequately represent racial/ethnic minorities. Efforts to reduce disparities and increase diversity in study cohorts have emerged, from patient navigation, to use of mobile technology to collect data, to national consortiums dedicated to including diverse groups, to university training on health disparities. These efforts point to the need for the Cancer Moonshot and precision medicine leaders to develop a multifaceted approach to address disparities in health and healthcare to promote a diverse healthcare workforce, patient-centered care, maintenance of a database of information regarding the state of health disparities, and the institution of measurable goals for improving care across all ethnic groups. If these elements are included, it is possible that the Cancer Moonshot and precision medicine will benefit the entire population of our country.","['cancer center', 'cancer classification', 'cancer control', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer incidence', 'cancer mortality', 'cancer prognosis', 'cancer research', 'cancer therapy', 'data mining', 'ethnicity', 'health care planning', 'health care policy', 'health disparity', 'health insurance', 'health promotion', 'human', 'information dissemination', 'letter', 'medical education', 'medical technology', 'national health organization', 'priority journal', 'United States']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-017-0927-6,1,0,USA,4,2017,7,0,,Cancer Causes & Control an International Journal of Studies of Cancer in Human Populations https://link-springer-com.meharry.idm.oclc.org/article/10.1007/s10552-017-0927-6,"cancer moonshot, health disparities",0,hispanic,USA,4,UT Health San Antonio,Dr.P.H.,1,1,white,USA,4,"UT Health San Antonio,",MD,1,,"USA, USA","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,"UT Health San Antonio, UT Health San Antonio","Dr.P.H., MD",1/1/22 00:00,,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['hispanic', 'white']",1,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,50%,

Most SDOH variables are still captured in the unstructured fields (i.e., free-text) of EHRs. In this study we attempt to evaluate a practical text mining approach (i.e., advanced pattern matching techniques) in identifying phrases referring to housing issues, an important SDOH domain affecting value-based healthcare providers, using EHR of a large multispecialty medical group in the New England region, United States. To present how this approach would help the health systems to address the SDOH challenges of their patients we assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with and without housing issues and briefly look into the patterns of healthcare utilization among the study population and for those with and without housing challenges. Methods: We identified five categories of housing issues [i.e., homelessness current (HC), homelessness history (HH), homelessness addressed (HA), housing instability (HI), and building quality (BQ)] and developed several phrases addressing each one through collaboration with SDOH experts, consulting the literature, and reviewing existing coding standards. We developed pattern-matching algorithms (i.e., advanced regular expressions), and then applied them in the selected EHR. We assessed the text mining approach for recall (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value) after comparing the identified phrases with manually annotated free-text for different housing issues. Results: The study dataset included EHR structured data for a total of 20,342 patients and 2,564,344 free-text clinical notes. The mean (SD) age in the study population was 75.96 (7.51). Additionally, 58.78% of the cohort were female. BQ and HI were the most frequent housing issues documented in EHR free-text notes and HH was the least frequent one. The regular expression methodology, when compared to manual annotation, had a high level of precision (positive predictive value) at phrase, note, and patient levels (96.36, 95.00, and 94.44%, respectively) across different categories of housing issues, but the recall (sensitivity) rate was relatively low (30.11, 32.20, and 41.46%, respectively). Conclusion: Results of this study can be used to advance the research in this domain, to assess the potential value of EHR's free-text in identifying patients with a high risk of housing issues, to improve patient care and outcomes, and to eventually mitigate socioeconomic disparities across individuals and communities.","['data mining', 'electronic health record', 'female', 'housing', 'human', 'retrospective study', 'social determinants of health', 'United States']",http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.697501,1,1,USA,4,2021,3,0,,Front Public Health,,0,asian,Iran,4,Tehran University of Medical Sciences,MD,0,1,asian,Iran,4,Tehran University,MD,0,,"Iran, India, Italy, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, Iran","2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,2",9,9,9,1,1,"Tehran University Medical School,  Johns Hopkins Medical School, University of Pennysylvania, Johns Hopkins School of Engineering,  Atrius Health, Tehran University Medical School ",,,,0,9,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Iran,India,Italy,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,Iran,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'asian']",4,0,0,5,0,9,9,0,44%,

Although regular follow-ups are recommended during pregnancy, not all pregnant women seek care. This pilot study wanted to assess whether the integration of data from administrative health information systems and socio-economic features allows identifying disparities in prenatal care trajectories.,Prenatal care trajectories were extracted from the permanent sample of the French health insurance information system linked to the hospital discharge information system. The records of 2518 women who gave birth without complications in France in 2009 were analyzed. State sequence data analysis was performed to identify homogeneous groups of prenatal care trajectories. Socio-economic data were used to characterize their living environment.,We identified three groups of homogeneous prenatal care trajectories: (i) women with relatively high prenatal care consumption (~11%), (ii) women with no prenatal care (~21%), and (iii) women with an intermediate level of prenatal care (~66%). Analysis of the socio-economic data demonstrated the association between disparities in prenatal care trajectories and the women's living environment. Women with relatively high care consumption generally lived in socio-economically privileged areas (better education levels, employment status and housing conditions) compared with women with few or no prenatal care.,Although ecological, our approach demonstrates that data from health administrative information systems could be used to describe prenatal care. However, more individual variables and an improvement of the data quality are needed to efficiently monitor the content and timing of prenatal care. Moreover, state sequence analysis, which was used in this context for the first time, proves to be an interesting approach to explore care trajectories. Finally, the integration of heterogeneous sources of data, including contextual information, might help identifying areas that require health promotion actions toward vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women.",,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276357868_Mining_care_trajectories_using_health_administrative_information_systems_The_use_of_state_sequence_analysis_to_assess_disparities_in_prenatal_care_consumption,1,1,France,4,2015,44,0,,BMC Health Services Research,,0,white,France,4,French School of Public Health- Sorbonne Paris Cite,PhD,0,0,white,France,4,"French School of Public Health-Sorbonne Paris Cite, France",PhD,0,,"France, France, France","4,4,4",3,3,3,1,1,"French School of Public Health- Sorbonne Paris Cite, French School of Public Health- Sorbonne Paris Cite, France, French School of Public Health- Sorbonne Paris Cite, France","PhD, PhD, PhD",0,,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,France,France,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'asian', 'white']",2,0,0,1,0,3,3,0,67%,

Linked mortality data have become a gold standard for monitoring socioeconomic differentials in survival. Several approaches have been proposed to assess the quality of the linkage, in order to avoid the misclassification of deaths according to socioeconomic status. However, the plausibility of mortality estimates has never been scrutinized from a demographic perspective, and the potential problems with the quality of the data on the at-risk populations have been overlooked. Methods: Using indirect demographic estimation (i.e., the synthetic extinct generation method), we analyze the plausibility of old-age mortality estimates according to educational attainment in four European data contexts with different quality issues: deterministic and probabilistic linkage of deaths, as well as differences in the methodology of the collection of educational data. We evaluate whether the at-risk population according to educational attainment is misclassified and/or misestimated, correct these biases, and estimate the education-specific linkage rates of deaths. Results: The results confirm a good linkage of death records within different educational strata, even when probabilistic matching is used. The main biases in mortality estimates concern the classification and estimation of the person-years of exposure according to educational attainment. Changes in the census questions about educational attainment led to inconsistent information over time, which misclassified the at-risk population. Sample censuses also misestimated the at-risk populations according to educational attainment. Conclusion: The synthetic extinct generation method can be recommended for quality assessments of linked data because it is capable not only of quantifying linkage precision, but also of tracking problems in the population data. Rather than focusing only on the quality of the linkage, more attention should be directed towards the quality of the self-reported socioeconomic status at censuses, as well as towards the accurate estimation of the at-risk populations.","['article', 'data mining', 'demography', 'educational status', 'Finland', 'human', 'information processing', 'Lithuania', 'mortality', 'plausibility', 'population research', 'priority journal', 'probability', 'senescence', 'social status', 'Spain', 'statistical bias', 'statistical concepts', 'Switzerland', 'synthetic extinct generation method']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28705165/,1,1,Europe,4,2017,3,1,LIVES-Overcoming Vulnerability: Life Course Perspectives and Swiss National Cohort,Population in Health Metrics,,1,white,Switzerland,4,University of Geneva,PhD,0,1,white,Spain,4,University of Seville,MD,0,,"Switzerland, Switzerland, Germany, Spain","4,4,4,4",4,4,4,1,1,"University of Geneva, University of Bern, Institute of Social Research, University of Seville ","PhD, PhD, PhD, MD ",,,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Switzerland,Switzerland,Germany,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', 'white']",4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,100%,

To assure the successful implementation of pan-African nutritional and health initiatives, cost-effective approaches considering similarities/disparities in economy, regional integration, development and nutritional aspects between countries are needed. In the absence of pre-existing models, we reviewed regional economic integration and nutritional indicators (n 13) available in international organisations databases or governmental agencies websites, for fifty-two African countries. These indicators were used to map the countries according to common languages (e.g. Arabic, English, French, Portuguese), development status (e.g. human development index), malnutrition status (e.g. obesity) and diet (e.g. staples predominantly based on either cereals or tubers). The review of the indicators showed that there exist similarities between African countries that can be exploited to benefit the continent with cross-national experiences in order to avoid duplication of efforts in the implementation of future pan-African health studies. In addition, including present and future nutrition surveillance programmes in Africa into national statistical systems might be cost-effective and sustainable in the longer term.","['African', 'conference paper', 'cost effectiveness analysis', 'dietary intake', 'food safety', 'geographic distribution', 'health disparity', 'human', 'incidence', 'malnutrition', 'nutrition', 'nutrition monitoring', 'nutrition surveillance', 'nutritional assessment', 'nutritional health', 'nutritional status', 'obesity', 'process optimization', 'socioeconomics', 'sustainable development']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0029665117004141,1,1,Africa,2,2018,1,0,,Proceedings of Nutrition Society,,1,black,France,4,Institute Agency of Research Cancer,PhD,0,0,white,France,4,University of Wagenigen,PhD,0,,"France, France, Ghana, France, France, Qatar, France","4,4,2,4,4,4,4",7,7,7,1,1,"Institue Agency of Research Cancer, University of Nottingham, University of Health and Allied Sciences School of Public Health, Unversity of Cambridge, University of Ghana Medical School, University of Wagenigan ","PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, MD, PhD",0,,0,7,7,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,France,France,Ghana,France,France,Qatar,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['black', 'white', 'black', 'white', 'white', 'black', 'white']",4,3,0,0,0,7,7,0,57%,

This analysis was done by using decision tree methodology applied to the Cuatro Santos health and demographic surveillance databases. Methods: Using variables derived from the health and demographic surveillance update 2014, transferring individual data to the household level we used the decision tree framework Conditional Inference trees to predict the outcome ""poverty"" defined as two to four unsatisfied basic needs using the Unsatisfied Basic Need Index. We further validated the trees by applying Conditional random forest analyses in order to assess and rank the importance of predictors about their ability to explain the variation of the outcome ""poverty."" The majority of the Cuatro Santos households provided information and the included variables measured housing conditions, assets, and demographic experiences since the last update (5 yrs), earlier participation in interventions and food security during the last 4 weeks. Results: Poverty was rare in households that have some assets and someone in the household that has a higher education than primary school. For these households participating in the intervention that installed piped water with water meter was most important, but also when excluding this variable, the resulting tree showed the same results. When assets were not taken into consideration, the importance of education was pronounced as a predictor for welfare. The results were further strengthened by the validation using Conditional random forest modeling showing the same variables being important as predicting the outcome in the CI tree analysis. As assets can be a result, rather than a predictor of more affluence our results in summary point specifically to the importance of education and participation in the water installation intervention as predictors for more affluence. Conclusion: Predictors of poverty are useful for directing interventions and in the Cuatro Santos area education seems most important to prioritize. Hopefully, the lessons learned can continue to develop the Cuatro Santos communities as well as development in similar poor rural settings around the world.","['adolescent', 'adult', 'aged', 'article', 'data mining', 'decision tree', 'demography', 'education', 'female', 'food security', 'health survey', 'household', 'human', 'male', 'Nicaragua', 'poverty', 'prediction', 'primary school', 'priority journal', 'random forest']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-019-1054-7,1,1,Nicaragua,2,2019,1,1,The Swedish Research Council,International Journal for Equity in Health,,0,white,Sweden,4,Oru School of Health and Medical Science,PhD,0,0,white,Sweden,4,Uppsala University,PhD,0,,"Sweden, Nicaragua, Nicaragua, Honduras, Sweden, Sweden, Russia, Sweden","4,2,2,2,4,4,3,4",8,8,8,1,1,"Uppsala University, Asociación para el Desarrollo Económico y Sostenible de El Espino, Uppsala University, Uppsala University,  Uppsala University,  Uppsala University, Linköping University, Uppsala University",,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0",,0,8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Sweden,Nicaragua,Nicaragua,Honduras,Sweden,Sweden,Russia,Sweden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'hispanic', 'hispanic', 'hispanic', 'hispanic', 'white', 'white', 'white']",4,0,4,0,0,8,8,0,50%,

This analysis is part of the World Health Organization Global Observatory on Health Research and Development's work with the overall aim to enable evidence-informed deliberations and decisions on new investments in health research and development. The analysis expands on the interactive data visualisations of these data on the Observatory's website and describes the methods used to enable the categorisation of grants by health categories using automated data-mining techniques.,Grants data were extracted from the World RePORT platform for 2016, the most recent year with data from all funders. A data-mining algorithm was developed in Java to categorise grants by health category. The analysis explored the distribution of grants by funder, recipient country and organisation, type of grant, health category, average grant duration, and the nature of collaborations between recipients of direct grants and the institutions they collaborated with.,Out of a total of 69,420 grants in 2016, the United States of America's National Institutes of Health funded the greatest number of grants (52,928; 76%) and had the longest average grant duration (6 years and 10 months). Grants for research constituted 70.4% (48,879) of all types of grants, followed by grants for training (13,008; 18.7%) and meetings (2907; 4.2%). Of grant recipients by income group, low-income countries received only 0.2% (165) of all grants. Almost three-quarters of all grants were for non-communicable diseases (72%; 40,035), followed by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (20%; 11,123), and injuries (6%; 3056). Only 1.1% of grants were for neglected tropical diseases and 0.4% for priority diseases on the WHO list of highly infectious (R&D blueprint) pathogens.,The findings highlight the importance of considering funding decisions by other actors in future health research and capacity-strengthening decisions. This will not only improve efficiency and equity in allocating scarce resources but will also allow informed investment decisions that aim to support research on public health needs and neglected areas.","['article', 'automation', 'communicable disease', 'data mining', 'funding', 'health care need', 'human', 'lowest income group', 'medical research', 'neglected disease', 'non communicable disease', 'public health', 'recipient', 'resource allocation', 'sensitivity analysis', 'tropical disease', 'United States']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-0532-0,1,1,Switzerland,4,2020,10,1,"e European Commission, the Government of France and the Government of Switzerland.","Health Research, Policy and System","Funding, Investments, Health research ",1,white,Switzerland,4,"Science Division, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland",-,0,1,white,Switzerland,4,"Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact Division, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.",-,0,,"Switzerland, Switzerland, Switzerland","4,4,4",3,3,3,1,1,"Science Division, World Health Organization, Geneva; Switzerland, Science Division, World Health Organization, Geneva; Switzerland, Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact Division, World Health Organization, Geneva; Switzerland.",,"0,0,0",,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Switzerland,Switzerland,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white",3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,100%,

We show how collective use of data mining and prediction algorithms to analyze socioeconomic population health data can stand beside classical correlation analysis in routine data analysis. The underlying theoretical basis is the Dirac notation and algebra that is a scientific standard but unusual outside of the physical sciences, combined with a theory of expected information first developed for analyzing sparse data but still largely confined to bioinformatics. The latter was important here because the records analyzed (which are for US counties and equivalents, not patients) are very few by contemporary data mining standards. The approach is very unlikely to be familiar to socioeconomic researchers, so the theory and the advantages of our inference nets over the Bayes Net are reviewed here, mostly using socioeconomic examples. While our expertise and focus is in regard to novel analytical methods rather than socioeconomics per se, a significant negative (countertrending) relationship between population health and equity was initially surprising, at least to the present authors. This encouraged deeper exploration including that of the relationship between our data mining methods and traditional Pearson's correlation. The latter is susceptible to giving wrong conclusions if a phenomenon called Simpson's paradox applies, so this is also investigated. Also discussed is that, even for very few records, associative data mining can still demand significant computational resources due to a combinatorial explosion.","['adult', 'analytic method', 'article', 'bioinformatics', 'correlation analysis', 'data analysis', 'data mining', 'decision support system', 'explosion', 'human', 'intermethod comparison', 'language', 'mathematics', 'population health', 'prediction', 'scientist', 'socioeconomics', 'theoretical study']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103369,1,1,None,None,2019,8,0,None,Computers in Biology and Medicin,"Data analytics, Data mining, Decision support, Hyperbolic Dirac net, Inference net, Population health,, Socioeconomic, Sparse data",1,white,UK,4,Dirac Foundation OxfordShire,PhD,0,1,white,UK,4,Dirac Foundation OxfordShire,PhD,0,,"UK, UK","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,Dirac Foundation OxfordShire,"PhD, PhD ",0,,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UK,UK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white",2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,100%,

The types and volume of data related to the symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and outcomes are increasingly accessible for research. Traditional data streams are now complemented by consumer-generated (i.e., quantified self) and ""omic"" data streams. Thus, the data available for symptom science can be considered big data. The purposes of this chapter are to (a) briefly summarize the current drivers for the use of big data in research; (b) describe the promise of big data and associated data science methods for advancing symptom management research; (c) explicate the potential perils of big data and data science from the perspective of the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice; and (d) illustrate strategies for balancing the promise and the perils of big data through a case study of a community at high risk for health disparities. Big data and associated data science methods offer the promise of multidimensional data sources and new methods to address significant research gaps in symptom management. If nurse scientists wish to apply big data and data science methods to advance symptom management research and promote health equity, they must carefully consider both the promise and perils.","['data mining', 'decision making', 'health disparity', 'human', 'model', 'nursing research', 'quality of life', 'risk management', 'symptom assessment']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1891/0739-6686.34.247,1,1,None,None,2016,29,1,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (R01HS022961) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (UL1TR000040).,Annual Review of Nursing Research,"Symptom, disparities, nursing care",0,white,USA,4,Columbia University Nursing School,PhD,0,0,white,USA,4,Columbia University Nursing School,PhD,0,,"USA, USA","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,"Columbia University Nursing School, Columbia University Nursing School","PhD, PhD ",0,,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white",2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,100%,

In this paper, we extend the general TVEA to deal with multivariate/multicategorical predictors and multivariate response variables. We designed algorithms and an R package for this extension and applied MMA on the NHANES data to identify MCs and quantify the indirect effect of each MC in explaining both racial and ethnic disparities in obesity and the body mass index (BMI) simultaneously.

Language discordance can increase processing times and hamper the trust building necessary for effective contact tracing. We demonstrate how matching predicted patient language with contact tracer language can enhance contact tracing. First, we show how to use machine learning to combine information from sparse laboratory reports with richer census data to predict the language of an incoming case. Second, we embed this method in the highly demanding environment of actual contact tracing with high volumes of cases in Santa Clara County, CA. Third, we evaluate this language-matching intervention in a randomized controlled trial. We show that this low-touch intervention results in 1) significant time savings, shortening the time from opening of cases to completion of the initial interview by nearly 14 h and increasing same-day completion by 12%, and 2) improved engagement, reducing the refusal to interview by 4%.

Given the predictive capacity of ML, it offers new opportunities for health, behavioral, and social scientists. However, it remains unclear how and to what extent ML is being used in studies of social determinants of health (SDH).,Using four search engines, we conducted a scoping review of studies that used ML to study SDH (published before May 1, 2020). Two independent reviewers analyzed the relevant studies. For each study, we identified the research questions, Results, data, and algorithms. We synthesized our findings in a narrative report.,Of the initial 8097 hits, we identified 82 relevant studies. The number of publications has risen during the past decade. More than half of the studies (n = 46) used US data. About 80% (n = 66) utilized surveys, and 70% (n = 57) employed ML for common prediction tasks. Although the number of studies in ML and SDH is growing rapidly, only a few studies used ML to improve causal inference, curate data, or identify social bias in predictions (i.e., algorithmic fairness).,While ML equips researchers with new ways to measure health outcomes and their determinants from non-conventional sources such as text, audio, and image data, most studies still rely on traditional surveys. Although there are no guarantees that ML will lead to better social epidemiological research, the potential for innovation in SDH research is evident as a result of harnessing the predictive power of ML for causality, data curation, or algorithmic fairness.",ReviewMachine learningSocial determinants of health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321001117,1,0,North America,4,2021,15,1,Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows,SSM - population health,"causality, algorithm",1,asian,Japan,4,Harvard T.H.

Whereas PPAs were reported to be initially successful in Germany and Japan, the killing of Black Americans by police in the US has sparked a call to dismantle AI in law enforcement. However, although PPAs may statistically associate suspects with economically disadvantaged classes and ethnic minorities, the targeted groups they aim to protect are often vulnerable populations as well (e.g., victims of human trafficking, kidnapping, domestic violence, or drug abuse). Thus, determining how to enhance the benefits of PPA while reducing bias through better management is important. In this paper, we propose a policy schema to address this issue. First, after clarifying relevant concepts, we examine major criticisms of PPAs and argue that some of them should be addressed. If banning AI or making it taboo is an unrealistic solution, we must learn from our errors to improve AI. We next identify additional challenges of PPAs and offer recommendations from a policy viewpoint. We conclude that the employment of PPAs should be merged into broader governance of the social safety net and audited publicly by parliament and civic society so that the unjust social structure that breeds bias can be revised.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34075448/,1,1,North America,4,2021,2,1,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (Grant No. 107-2410-H-001-101-MY3).",Science and engineering ethics,Equity; Predictive policing algorithm; Racism,0,asian,Taiwan,4,"Institute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica",BS,0,1,asian,Taiwan,4,"Institute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica",PhD,0,,"Taiwan, Taiwan","3,3",2,2,2,1,1,"Institute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica","BS,PhD",0,,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Taiwan,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian,asian",0,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0%,

Detection of pre-cancerous cervical changes provides a window of opportunity for cure of an otherwise lethal disease when metastatic. With a greater understanding of the biology and natural course of high-risk HPV infections, screening methods have shifted beyond subjective Pap smears toward more sophisticated and objective tactics. This has led to a substantial growth in the breadth and depth of HPV-based cervical cancer screening tests, especially in developed countries without constrained resources. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have less access to advanced laboratories and healthcare resources, so new point-of-care (POC) technologies have been developed to provide test results in real time, improve the efficiency of techniques, and increase screening adoption.

For risk modeling, each factor was fitted by a generalized linear model to predict the cause specific survival. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were computed. Similar strata were combined to construct the most parsimonious models. A random sampling algorithm was used to estimate modeling errors. Risk of glassy cell carcinoma death was computed for the predictors for comparison.,There were 79 patients included in this study. The mean follow up time (S.D.) was 37 (32.8) months. Female patients outnumbered males 4:1. The mean (S.D.) age was 54.4 (19.8) years. SEER stage was the most predictive factor of outcome (ROC area of 0.69). The risks of cause specific death were, respectively, 9.4% for localized, 16.7% for regional, 35% for the un-staged/others category, and 60% for distant disease. After optimization, separation between the regional and unstaged/others category was removed with a higher ROC area of 0.72.

Many of the challenges with respect to integrity previously facing competitive sport have been accentuated further during the pandemic. Threats to the integrity of sporting competition include traditional doping, issues of technological fairness, and integration of transgender and intersex athletes in elite sport. The enforced lull in competitive sport provides an unprecedented opportunity for stakeholders in sport to focus on unresolved integrity issues and develop and implement long-lasting solutions. There needs to be a concerted effort to focus on the many technological innovations accelerated by and perfected during COVID-19 that have enabled us to work from home, such as teaching students on-line, applications for medical advice, prescriptions and referrals, and treating patients in hospitals/care homes via video links and use these developments and innovations to enhance sport integrity and anti-doping procedures. Positive sports integrity actions will require a considered application of all such technology, as well as the inclusion of ""omics"" technology, big data, bioinformatics and machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches to modernize sport. Applications include protecting the health of athletes, considered non-discriminative integration of athletes into elite sport, intelligent remote testing to improve the frequency of anti-doping tests, detection windows, and the potential combination with omics technology to improve the tests' sensitivity and specificity in order to protect clean athletes and deter doping practices.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34256541/,1,0,Italy,4,2021,3,0,,The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness,"gender, race",1,hispanic,Brazil,3,"Foro Italico University of Rome, Rome, Italy.",PhD,0,1,white,UK,4,"Universidade Foro Italico de Roma, Roma, Itália; 2 Centro de Estresse e Doenças Relacionadas à Idade, Universidade de Brighton, Brighton, Reino Unido",PhD,0,,"Brazil, Spain, United kingdom, United kingdom, United kingdom, Greece, South Africa, Italy, Italy, Italy, Italy, United kingdom","3, 4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4",12,12,12,1,1,"Foro Italico University of Rome, Rome, Italy.

We used latent Dirichlet allocation to discover evaluative ""topics"" (i.e., words that co-occur with high probability). We then qualitatively examined the context in which evaluative words occurred for male and female investigators. We also examined sex differences in assigned scores controlling for investigator productivity.,Text analysis results showed that male investigators were described as ""leaders"" and ""pioneers"" in their ""fields,"" with ""highly innovative"" and ""highly significant research."" By comparison, female investigators were characterized as having ""expertise"" and working in ""excellent"" environments. Applications from men received significantly better priority, approach, and significance scores, which could not be accounted for by differences in productivity.,Results confirm our previous analyses suggesting that gender stereotypes operate in R01 grant peer review.

The aim of this narrative review was to describe: (1) studies on AI tools that can be used to measure and increase medication adherence in patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs); (2) the benefits of using AI for these purposes; (3) challenges of the use of AI in healthcare; and (4) priorities for future research. We discuss the current AI technologies, including mobile phone applications, reminder systems, tools for patient empowerment, instruments that can be used in integrated care, and machine learning. The use of AI may be key to understanding the complex interplay of factors that underly medication non-adherence in NCD patients. AI-assisted interventions aiming to improve communication between patients and physicians, monitor drug consumption, empower patients, and ultimately, increase adherence levels may lead to better clinical outcomes and increase the quality of life of NCD patients. However, the use of AI in healthcare is challenged by numerous factors; the characteristics of users can impact the effectiveness of an AI tool, which may lead to further inequalities in healthcare, and there may be concerns that it could depersonalize medicine. The success and widespread use of AI technologies will depend on data storage capacity, processing power, and other infrastructure capacities within healthcare systems. Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI solutions in different patient groups and establish the barriers to widespread adoption, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a rapid increase in the use and development of digital health technologies.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713142/,1,0,United kingdom,4,2021,0,1,"Viatris, UK",Frontiers in Digital Health,"digital health,",0,asian,India,2,"Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom",high school,0,1,asian,India,2,"Viatris, Surrey, United Kingdom.",MD,0,,"India, india, Italy, France, India","2,2,4,4,2",5,5,5,1,1,"Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom, Pfizer Ltd, Mumbai, India,  Viatris, Rome, Italy.,  HEC, Paris, France, Viatris, Surrey, United Kingdom.","high school, MD, MD, PhD, MD",0,,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,India,india,Italy,France,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian , asian, white, white, asian",2,0,0,3,0,5,5,0,40%,

Health information communication from the World Health Organization is governed by key principles including health information relevance, credibility, understandability, actionability, accessibility. Multilingual health information developed under these principles provide valuable benchmarks to assess the quality of health resources developed by local health authorities. In this paper, we developed machine learning classifiers for health professionals with or without Chinese proficiency to assess public-oriented health information in Chinese based on the definition of effective health communication by the WHO. We compared our optimized classifier (SVM_F5) with the state-of-art Chinese readability classifier (Chinese Readability Index Explorer CRIE 3.0), and classifiers adapted from established English readability formula, Gunning Fog Index, Automated Readability Index. Our optimized classifier achieved statistically significant higher area under the receiver operator curve (AUC of ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than those of SVM using CRIE 3.0 features and SVM using linguistic features of Gunning Fog Index and Automated Readability Index (ARI). The statistically improved performance of our optimized classifier compared to that of SVM classifiers adapted from popular readability formula suggests that evaluation of health communication effectiveness as defined by the principles of the WHO is more complex than information readability assessment. Our SVM classifier validated on health information covering diverse topics (environmental health, infectious diseases, pregnancy, maternity care, non-communicable diseases, tobacco control) can aid effectively in the automatic assessment of original, translated Chinese public health information of whether they satisfy or not the current international standard of effective health communication as set by the WHO.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34639643/,1,1,China,4,2021,0,0,-,International Journal  Of Environmental Research  and Public Health,Chinese health resources; accessibility; health translation; readability,0,asian,UK,4,"The University of Sydney, Sydney",PhD,0,0,asian,China,4,"The University of Sydney, Sydney",Phd,0,,"UK, Ghana, China, china","4,2,3,3",4,4,4,1,1,"School of Languages and Cultures, The University of Sydney, Sydney 2006, Australia, Department of African Studies, The University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria, Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 518057, China","PhD,PhD,Master Managenent science,  Phd",0,,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,UK,Ghana,China,china,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asian, Black, Asian, Asian",0,1,0,3,0,4,4,0,0%,

However, inspite of initial efforts at understanding the contributions of SARS-CoV-2 variants, most were unable to delineate causality. Hence, in this study we re-visited the contributions of different clades of viruses (G, GR and GH) along with other attributes in explaining the disparity in mortality rates among countries. A total of 26,642 high quality SARS-CoV-2 sequences were included and the A23,403G (S:D614G) variant was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with C14,408 U (RdRp: P323L). Linear regression analyses revealed increase in age [Odds ratio: 1.055 (p-value 0.000358)] and higher frequency of clade-G viruses [Odds ratio: 1.029(p-value 0.000135)] could explain 37.43% of the differences in mortality rates across the 58 countries (Multiple R-squared: 0.3743). Next, Machine-Learning algorithms LogitBoost and AdaboostM1 were applied to determine whether countries belonging to high/low mortality groups could be classified using the same attributes and accurate classification was achieved in 70.69% and 62.07% of the countries, respectively. Further, evolutionary analyses of the Indian viral population (n = 662) were carried out. Allele frequency spectrum, nucleotide diversity (œÄ) values and negative Tajima's D values across ORFs were indicative of population expansion. Network analysis revealed the presence of two major clusters of viral haplotypes, namely, clade-G and a variant of clade L [Lv] having the RdRp:A97V amino acid change. Clade-G genomes were found to be evolving more rapidly and were also found in higher proportions in three states with highest mortality rates namely, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. Thus, the findings of this study and results from in vitro studies highlighting the role of these variants in increasing transmissibility and altering response to antivirals reflect the role of viral factors in disease prognosis.",COVID-19 mortality; Clade-G; India; Phylogenetic networks; SARS-CoV-2.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33508515/,1,1,India,2,2021,14,1,"B.B was supported by the Ramanujan fellowship funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.",Elsevier Public Health Emergency Collection,"race, health conditions",0,asian,India,2,"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India",PhD,0,0,asian,India,2,"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India",PhD,0,,"India, India, India","2,2,2",3,3,3,1,1,"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India","PhD, PhD, PhD, ",0,,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,India,India,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, asian",0,0,0,3,0,3,3,0,0%,

In academic health systems, care is provided by a mix of trainees and faculty members. The optimal staffing ratio of trainees to faculty members (T/F) in radiology is unknown but may be related to the complexity of patients requiring care. Hospital characteristics, patient demographics, and radiology report findings may serve as markers of risk for poor outcomes because of patient complexity.,Descriptive characteristics of each hospital in an urban five-hospital academic health system, including payer distribution and race, were collected. Radiology department T/F ratios were calculated. A natural language processing model was used to classify multimodal report findings into nonacute, acute, and critical, with report acuity calculated as the fraction of acute and critical findings. Patient race, payer type, T/F ratio, and report acuity score for hospital 1, a safety net hospital, were compared with these factors for hospitals 2 to 5.,The fraction of patients at hospital 1 who are Black (79%) and have Medicaid insurance (28%) is significantly higher than at hospitals 2 to 5 (P < .0001), with the exception of hospital 3 (80.1% black). The T/F ratio of 1.37 at hospital 1 as well as its report acuity (28.9%) were significantly higher (P < .0001 for both).,T/F ratio and report acuity are highest at hospital 1, which serves the most at-risk patient population.

This field has matured rapidly in the past several years. There was initial fascination with the algorithms themselves (machine learning, deep learning, convoluted neural networks) and the use of these algorithms to make predictions that often surpassed prevailing benchmarks. As the discipline has matured, individuals have called attention to aberrancies in the output of these algorithms. In particular, criticisms have been widely circulated that algorithmically developed models may have limited generalizability due to overfitting to the training data and may systematically perpetuate various forms of biases inherent in the training data, including race, gender, age, and health state or fitness level (Challen et al.

This includes both clinical and research settings, and newly in specialties like rheumatology. It is, however, important to consider how these new methodologies are used, and particularly the sensitivities associated with personal information. Based on current applications in rheumatology, this article provides a narrative review of the bioethical perspectives of big data. It presents examples of databases, data analytic methods, and AI in this specialty to address four main ethical issues: privacy and confidentiality, informed consent, the impact on the medical profession, and justice. The use of big data and AI processing in healthcare has great potential to improve the quality of clinical care, including through better diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. They may also increase patient and societal participation and engagement in healthcare and research. Developing these methodologies and using the information generated from them in line with ethical standards could positively affect the design of global health policies and introduce a new phase in the democratization of health.Key Points‚Ä¢ Current applications of big data, data analytics, and AI in rheumatology-including registries, machine learning algorithms, and consumer-facing platforms-raise issues in four main bioethical areas: privacy and confidentiality, informed consent, the impact on the medical profession, and justice.‚Ä¢ Bioethical concerns about rheumatology registries require careful consideration of privacy provisions, set within the context of local, national, and regional law.‚Ä¢ Machine learning and big data aid diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, but the final decision about the use of information from algorithms should be left to rheumatology specialists to maintain the promise of fiduciary obligations in the physician-patient relationship.‚Ä¢ International collaboration in big data projects and increased patient engagement could be ways to counteract health inequalities in the practice of rheumatology, even on a global scale.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32062767/,1,0,,,2020,11,0,,Clinical Rheumatology,"privacy, consent, justice",0,hispanic,Mexico,3,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,BSc,0,0,hispanic,Mexico,3,Hospital General de México,MD,0,,"Mexico, Mexico","3,3",2,2,2,1,1,"Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Hospital General de México","BSc, MD","0, 0",,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mexico,Mexico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"hispanic, hispanic",0,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,0%,

Exponential growth of telecommunications and mobile phone ownership have presented new possibilities for digital health (use of data to drive health care), e-health (use of electronic processes in health care), and m-health (use of mobile technologies in health care). From machine learning and natural language processing to genomics and metabolomics, advanced analytics are being developed to improve health outcomes.
 
 Health inequalities are well documented within and across countries, and the role of social determinants is increasingly recognized as an important factor driving these differences. Could digital technologies and their associated healthcare strategies improve these health inequalities by making information and expertise more scalable and widely available? Or will they perpetuate or even worsen these widespread differences?
 
 Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the cause of greatest morbidity and mortality worldwide, are the ideal lens through which to explore these issues and the future of global health in the era of digital health. According to the GBD study (Global Burden of Disease),1 which celebrated its 20th anniversary in October, CVD disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but technologies are widely transforming societal trends across many LMICs.

The data sets were the yearly historical mortality rates between 1960s and 2017, obtained from the World Bank website. Two scenarios of mortality trajectories were simulated: (1) status quo scenarios-assuming the current trend continues; and (2) acceleration scenarios-consistent with the SDG targets.,At the projected rates of decline of 2.0% for NMR and 1.2% for U5MR, Nigeria will not achieve the child survival SDG targets by 2030. Unexpectedly, U5MR will begin to increase by 2028. To put Nigeria back on track, annual reduction rates of 7.8% for NMR and 10.7% for U5MR are required. Also, female U5MR is decreasing more slowly than male U5MR. At the end of SDG era, female deaths will be higher than male deaths (80.9 vs 62.6 deaths per 1000 live births).,Nigeria is not likely to achieve SDG targets for child survival and gender equities because female disadvantages will worsen. A plausible reason for the projected increase in female mortality is societal discrimination and victimisation faced by female child. Stakeholders in Nigeria need to adequately plan for child health to achieve SDG targets by 2030. Addressing gender inequities in childhood mortality in Nigeria would require gender-sensitive policies and community mobilisation against gender-based discrimination towards female child.",,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/1/e040302.info,1,1,Nigeria,2,2021,1,0,,BMJ Open,"income, gender, age",1,black,Nigeria,2,Federal Ministry of Health,MD,0,1,asian,Canada,4,University of Saskatchewan,PhD,0,,"Nigeria, Canada, Canada, Canada","2,4,4,4",4,4,4,1,1,"Federal Ministry of Health, University of Saskatchewan, Gombe State University, University of Saskatchewan","PhD, PhD, MD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Nigeria,Canada,Canada,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"black, white, black, asian",1,2,0,1,0,4,4,0,25%,

In its advanced forms it carries severe outcomes and can lead to death. It is thus important to detect the disease as early as possible, which can help devise effective intervention and treatment plan. Here we investigate ways to utilize information available in electronic health records (EHRs) from regular office visits of more than 13,000 patients, in order to distinguish among several stages of the disease. While clinical data stored in EHRs provide valuable information for risk-stratification, one of the major challenges in using them arises from data imbalance. That is, records associated with a more severe condition are typically under-represented compared to those associated with a milder manifestation of the disease. To address imbalance, we propose and develop a sampling-based ensemble approach, hierarchical meta-classification, aiming to stratify CKD patients into severity stages, using simple quantitative non-text features gathered from standard office visit records.,The proposed hierarchical meta-classification method frames the multiclass classification task as a hierarchy of two subtasks. The first is binary classification, separating records associated with the majority class from those associated with all minority classes combined, using meta-classification. The second subtask separates the records assigned to the combined minority classes into the individual constituent classes.,The proposed method identifies a significant proportion of patients suffering from the more advanced stages of the condition, while also correctly identifying most of the less severe cases, maintaining high sensitivity, specificity and F-measure (‚â• 93%). Our results show that the high level of performance attained by our method is preserved even when the size of the training set is significantly reduced, demonstrating the stability and generalizability of our approach.,We present a new approach to perform classification while addressing data imbalance, which is inherent in the biomedical domain. Our model effectively identifies severity stages of CKD patients, using information readily available in office visit records within the realistic context of high data imbalance.",,https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-018-0675-x,1,1,USA,4,2018,3,1,"NIGMS, NSF",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,"data bias, underrepresentation",0,asian,USA,4,University of Delaware,PhD,0,0,white,USA,4,University of Delaware,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA","4,4,4",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Delaware, Christiana Health Care System, University of Delaware","PhD, MD, PhD","0, 0, 0",,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, white, white",2,0,0,1,0,3,3,0,67%,

Eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) Female individuals aged 12 to 55 years with a live birth record identified by delivery-related codes from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2018; (2) greater than 80% enrollment through pregnancy to 60 days post partum; and (3) evidence of coverage for depression screening and mental health services. Statistical analysis was performed in 2020.,Binarized race (Black individuals and White individuals).,Machine learning models (logistic regression [LR], random forest, and extreme gradient boosting) were trained for 2 binary outcomes: postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum mental health service utilization. Risk-adjusted generalized linear models were used for each outcome to assess potential disparity in the cohort associated with binarized race (Black or White). Methods for reducing bias, including reweighing, Prejudice Remover, and removing race from the models, were examined by analyzing changes in fairness metrics compared with the base models. Baseline characteristics of female individuals at the top-predicted risk decile were compared for systematic differences. Fairness metrics of disparate impact (DI, 1 indicates fairness) and equal opportunity difference (EOD, 0 indicates fairness).,Among 573 634 female individuals initially examined for this study, 314 903 were White (54.9%), 217 899 were Black (38.0%), and the mean (SD) age was 26.1 (5.5) years. The risk-adjusted odds ratio comparing White participants with Black participants was 2.06 (95% CI, 2.02-2.10) for clinically recognized PPD and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.33-1.40) for postpartum mental health service utilization. Taking the LR model for PPD prediction as an example, reweighing reduced bias as measured by improved DI and EOD metrics from 0.31 and -0.19 to 0.79 and 0.02, respectively. Removing race from the models had inferior performance for reducing bias compared with the other methods (PPD: DI = 0.61; EOD = -0.05; mental health service utilization: DI = 0.63; EOD = -0.04).,Clinical prediction models trained on potentially biased data may produce unfair outcomes on the basis of the chosen metrics. This study's results suggest that the performance varied depending on the model, outcome label, and method for reducing bias. This approach toward evaluating algorithmic bias can be used as an example for the growing number of researchers who wish to examine and address bias in their data and models.","Adolescent

Prior work has suggested that DCNNs can predict sex on CXR, which could aid forensic evaluations, but also be a source of bias.,To (1) evaluate the performance of DCNNs for predicting sex across different datasets and architectures and (2) evaluate visual biomarkers used by DCNNs to predict sex on CXRs.,Chest radiographs were obtained from the Stanford CheXPert and NIH Chest XRay14 datasets which comprised of 224,316 and 112,120 CXRs, respectively. To control for dataset size and class imbalance, random undersampling was used to reduce each dataset to 97,560 images that were balanced for sex. Each dataset was randomly split into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) sets. Four DCNN architectures pre-trained on ImageNet were used for transfer learning. DCNNs were externally validated using a test set from the opposing dataset. Performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Class activation mapping (CAM) was used to generate heatmaps visualizing the regions contributing to the DCNN's prediction.,On the internal test set, DCNNs achieved AUROCs ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. On external validation, the models reached peak cross-dataset performance of 0.94 for the VGG19-Stanford model and 0.95 for the InceptionV3-NIH model. Heatmaps highlighted similar regions of attention between model architectures and datasets, localizing to the mediastinal and upper rib regions, as well as to the lower chest/diaphragmatic regions.,DCNNs trained on two large CXR datasets accurately predicted sex on internal and external test data with similar heatmap localizations across DCNN architectures and datasets. These findings support the notion that DCNNs can leverage imaging biomarkers to predict sex and potentially confound the accurate prediction of disease on CXRs and contribute to biased models. On the other hand, these DCNNs can be beneficial to emergency radiologists for forensic evaluations and identifying patient sex for patients whose identities are unknown, such as in acute trauma.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006495/,1,1,,,2022,0,0,,Emergency Radiology,gender,1,asian,Canada,4,University of Ottawa,MS,1,1,asian,USA,4,University of Maryland,MD,1,,"Canada, USA, Argentina, USA","4,4,3,4",4,4,4,1,1,"University of Ottawa / University of Maryland, University of Maryland, University of Maryland, University of Maryland","MS, MD, PhD, MD","1, 0, 0, 1",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Canada,USA,Argentina,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, white, asian",1,0,0,3,0,4,4,0,25%,

However, the biomedical data inequality between different ethnic groups is set to generate new health care disparities through data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions. Using an extensive set of machine learning experiments on cancer omics data, we find that current prevalent schemes of multiethnic machine learning are prone to generating significant model performance disparities between ethnic groups. We show that these performance disparities are caused by data inequality and data distribution discrepancies between ethnic groups. We also find that transfer learning can improve machine learning model performance for data-disadvantaged ethnic groups, and thus provides an effective approach to reduce health care disparities arising from data inequality among ethnic groups.",,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18918-3,1,1,,,2020,37,1,University of Tennessee,Nature Communications,race,1,asian,USA,4,University of Tennessee,PhD,0,1,asian,USA,4,University of Tennessee,PhD,0,,"USA, USA","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,"University of Tennessee, University of Tennessee","PhD, PhD","0, 0",,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian",0,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0%,

Most data sets reported demographics in some form (19 of 23; 82.6%) and on an image level (17 of 23; 73.9%).

Of the 13 data sets with sex distribution readily available, the average breakdown was 55.2% male subjects, ranging from 47.8% to 69.7% male representation. Of these, 8 (61.5%) overrepresented male subjects and 5 (38.5%) overrepresented female subjects.,Although most publicly available CXR data sets report age and sex on an image-basis level, few report race or ethnicity and insurance status. Furthermore, these data sets frequently underrepresent one of the sexes, more frequently the female sex. We recommend that data sets report standard demographic variables, and when possible, balance demographic representation to mitigate bias. Furthermore, for researchers using these data sets, we recommend that attention be paid to balancing demographic labels in addition to disease labels, as well as developing training methods that can account for these imbalances.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35033310/,1,1,"USA, China, Japan","4,3,2004",2021,1,0,-,Journal of the American College of Radiology,gender,1,Asian,USA,4,University of Maryland School of Medicine,MD,1,0,White,USA,4,Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,MD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4",4,4,4,1,1,University of Maryland School of Medicine; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; University of Maryland School of Medicine; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,"MD, MD, MD, MD","1,0,1,0",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, white, white",2,0,0,2,0,4,4,0,50%,

People from low socioeconomic and educational backgrounds as well as low health literacy tend to be affected by the uncertainty, complexity, volatility, and progressiveness of public health crises and emergencies. A key lesson that governments have taken from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is the importance of developing and disseminating highly accessible, actionable, inclusive, coherent public health advice, which represent a critical tool to help people with diverse cultural, educational backgrounds and varying abilities to effectively implement health policies at the grassroots level.,We aimed to translate the best practices of accessible, inclusive public health advice (purposefully designed for people with low socioeconomic and educational background, health literacy levels, limited English proficiency, and cognitive/functional impairments) on COVID-19 from health authorities in English-speaking multicultural countries (USA, Australia, and UK) to adaptive tools for the evaluation of the accessibility of public health advice in other languages.,We developed an optimised Bayesian classifier to produce probabilistic prediction of the accessibility of official health advice among vulnerable people including migrants and foreigners living in China. We developed an adaptive statistical formula for the rapid evaluation of the accessibility of health advice among vulnerable people in China.,Our study provides needed research tools to fill in a persistent gap in Chinese public health research on accessible, inclusive communication of infectious diseases' prevention and management. For the probabilistic prediction, using the optimised Bayesian machine learning classifier (GNB), the largest positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 16.685 (95% confidence interval: 4.35, 64.04) was identified when the probability threshold was set at 0.2 (sensitivity: 0.98; specificity: 0.94).,Effective communication of health risks through accessible, inclusive, actionable public advice represents a powerful tool to reduce health inequalities amidst health crises and emergencies. Our study translated the best-practice public health advice developed during the pandemic into intuitive machine learning classifiers for health authorities to develop evidence-based guidelines of accessible health advice. In addition, we developed adaptive statistical tools for frontline health professionals to assess accessibility of public health advice for people from non-English speaking backgrounds.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925484/,1,1,China,3,2021,0,0,-,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,socioeconomic disparities,0,Asian,China,3,City University of Hong Kong,PhD,0,1,Asian,China,3,South China Normal University,PhD,0,,"China, Australia, Australia, China, China, China","3,4,4,3,3,3",6,6,6,1,1,City University of Hong Kong; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; South China Normal University,"PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD","0,0,0,0,0,0",,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,China,Australia,Australia,China,China,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, asian, asian, asian, asian",0,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,0%,

AI systems are developed using data that reflect the implicit and explicit biases of society, and there are significant concerns about how the predictive models in AI systems amplify inequity, privilege, and power in society. The widespread applications of AI have led to mainstream discourse about how AI systems are perpetuating racism, sexism, and classism; yet, concerns about ageism have been largely absent in the AI bias literature. Given the globally aging population and proliferation of AI, there is a need to critically examine the presence of age-related bias in AI systems. This forum article discusses ageism in AI systems and introduces a conceptual model that outlines intersecting pathways of technology development that can produce and reinforce digital ageism in AI systems. We also describe the broader ethical and legal implications and considerations for future directions in digital ageism research to advance knowledge in the field and deepen our understanding of how ageism in AI is fostered by broader cycles of injustice.","digital ageism, ageisdigital ageism, ageism, artificial intelligence, bias, technologym",https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/330156,1,0,Canada,4,2022,6,1,Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence,The Gerontologist,age,0,Asian,Canada,4,University of Toronto,PhD,0,0,White,Canada,4,University of Toronto,PhD,0,,"Canada, UK, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, UK, Canada, Iran, Canada","4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,4",10,10,10,1,1,University of Toronto/University Health Network; University of Cambridge; Athabasca University; University of Cambridge/University of London; University Health Network/University of Toronto; McGill University/Mila-Quebec AI Institute; University of Toronto,"PhD, PhD, PhD, MPH, PhD, ?, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD","0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",,0,10,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Canada,UK,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,UK,Canada,Iran,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'white', 'white', 'asian', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'asian', 'asian', 'white']",6,0,0,4,0,10,10,0,60%,

The primary outcome was treatment with radical prostatectomy at hospitals that have adopted robotic surgery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with radical prostatectomy performed at hospitals with robotic surgery.,Overall 20,424 (68.5%) patients were surgically treated with radical prostatectomy at hospitals with robotic surgery, while 9,413 (31.5%) underwent radical prostatectomy at hospitals without robotic surgery. There was a marked increase in radical prostatectomy at hospital adopters from 55.8% in 2006 and 70.7% in 2007 to 76.1% in 2008 (p <0.001 for trend). After adjusting for patient and hospital features, lower odds of undergoing radical prostatectomy at hospitals with robotic surgery were seen in black patients (OR 0.81, p <0.001) and Hispanic patients (OR 0.77, p <0.001) vs white patients. Compared to having private health insurance, being primarily insured with Medicaid (OR 0.70, p <0.001) was also associated with lower odds of being treated at hospitals with robotic surgery.,Although there was a rapid shift of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to hospitals with robotic surgery from 2006 to 2008, black and Hispanic patients or those primarily insured by Medicaid were less likely to undergo radical prostatectomy at such hospitals.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022534712048458,1,1,USA,4,2013,46,0,-,AUA The Journal of Urology,socioeconomic disparities,1,Asian,USA,4,Mayo Clinic,MD/PhD,0,1,White,USA,4,Mayo Clinic,MD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",11,11,11,1,1,Mayo Clinic,MD/PhD; MD; PhD; MD; MD; PhD; MD; MD; PhD; PC; MD,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",,0,11,11,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'white', 'asian', 'white', 'white', '-', 'white', 'asian', 'asian', '-', 'white']",5,0,0,4,2,11,11,0,45%,

The mathematical model proposed here uses different sources of information to predict the probability of organ survival at different thresholds for each donor-recipient pair considered. Currently, this decision is mainly based on the Model for End-stage Liver Disease, which depends only on the severity of the recipient and obviates donor-recipient compatibility. We therefore propose to use information concerning the donor, the recipient and the surgery, with the objective of allocating the organ correctly.,The database consists of information concerning transplants conducted in 7 different Spanish hospitals and the King's College Hospital (United Kingdom). The state of the patients is followed up for 12 months. We propose to treat the problem as an ordinal classification one, where we predict the organ survival at different thresholds: less than 15 days, between 15 and 90 days, between 90 and 365 days and more than 365 days. This discretization is intended to produce finer-grain survival information (compared with the common binary approach). However, it results in a highly imbalanced dataset in which more than 85% of cases belong to the last class. To solve this, we combine two approaches, a cost-sensitive evolutionary ordinal artificial neural network (ANN) (in which we propose to incorporate dynamic weights to make more emphasis on the worst classified classes) and an ordinal over-sampling technique (which adds virtual patterns to the minority classes and thus alleviates the imbalanced nature of the dataset).,The results obtained by our proposal are promising and satisfactory, considering the overall accuracy, the ordering of the classes and the sensitivity of minority classes. In this sense, both the dynamic costs and the over-sampling technique improve the base results of the considered ANN-based method. Comparing our model with other state-of-the-art techniques in ordinal classification, competitive results can also be appreciated. The results achieved with this proposal improve the ones obtained by other state-of-the-art models: we were able to correctly predict more than 73% of the transplantation results, with a geometric mean of the sensitivities of 31.46%, which is much higher than the one obtained by other models.,The combination of the proposed cost-sensitive evolutionary algorithm together with the application of an over-sampling technique improves the predictive capability of our model in a significant way (especially for minority classes), which can help the surgeons make more informed decisions about the most appropriate recipient for an specific donor organ, in order to maximize the probability of survival after the transplantation and therefore the fairness principle.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28545607/,1,1,UK,4,2017,33,0,-,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,health conditions,1,white,Spain,4,University of Córdoba,PhD,0,1,white,Spain,4,University of Córdoba,PhD,0,,"Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain, Spain","4,4,4,4,4,4",6,6,6,1,1,University of Córdoba; Universidad Loyola Andalucía; University of Córdoba; Reina Sofía Hospital; Reina Sofía Hospital; University of Córdoba,"PhD, PhD, PhD, MD, MD, Phd","0,0,0,0,0,0",,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Spain,Spain,Spain,Spain,Spain,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white,white,white,white,white, white",6,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,100%,

However, these technologies will not replace the fundamental components of the health system, such as ethical leadership and governance, or avoid the need for a robust ethical and regulatory environment. In this paper, we discuss what a robust ethical and regulatory environment might look like for big data analytics in health insurance, and describe examples of safeguards and participatory mechanisms that should be established. First, a clear and effective data governance framework is critical. Legal standards need to be enacted and insurers should be encouraged and given incentives to adopt a human-centred approach in the design and use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence. Second, a clear and accountable process is necessary to explain what information can be used and how it can be used. Third, people whose data may be used should be empowered through their active involvement in determining how their personal data may be managed and governed. Fourth, insurers and governance bodies, including regulators and policy-makers, need to work together to ensure that the big data analytics based on artificial intelligence that are developed are transparent and accurate. Unless an enabling ethical environment is in place, the use of such analytics will likely contribute to the proliferation of unconnected data systems, worsen existing inequalities, and erode trustworthiness and trust.,Les progr√®s technologiques en mati√®re de big data (un terme qui d√©signe de grandes quantit√©s de donn√©es extr√™mement vari√©es, provenant de diff√©rentes sources et pouvant √™tre trait√©es rapidement), de sciences de l'information et d'intelligence artificielle peuvent am√©liorer le fonctionnement du syst√®me de sant√©, mais aussi promouvoir des soins personnalis√©s et servir l'int√©r√™t public. N√©anmoins, ces technologies ne permettront pas de remplacer les composantes fondamentales du syst√®me de sant√©, comme le leadership √©thique et la bonne gouvernance, ni d'√©viter la n√©cessit√© de cr√©er un environnement d√©ontologique et r√©glementaire solide. Le pr√©sent document se penche sur la d√©finition de cet environnement d√©ontologique et r√©glementaire solide pour l'analyse des big data dans le domaine de l'assurance maladie, et fournit √† titre d'exemple les m√©canismes de protection et de participation qu'il convient d'instaurer. En premier lieu, imposer un cadre de gouvernance pr√©cis et efficace est essentiel au traitement des donn√©es. Des normes juridiques doivent √™tre promulgu√©es, tandis que les assureurs doivent √™tre encourag√©s et incit√©s √† adopter une approche centr√©e sur l'humain, tant dans leur conception que dans leur utilisation de l'analyse des big data et de l'intelligence artificielle. Deuxi√®mement, il faut mettre en place un processus clair et responsable afin d'expliquer quels types d'informations sont susceptibles d'√™tre employ√©s et √† quelles fins. Troisi√®mement, les personnes concern√©es doivent avoir la possibilit√© de d√©terminer de quelle mani√®re leurs donn√©es personnelles sont g√©r√©es et r√©gies, en √©tant activement impliqu√©es dans ce processus. Et quatri√®mement, les assureurs et les organes de gouvernance, dont les r√©gulateurs et l√©gislateurs, doivent collaborer pour faire en sorte que l'analyse des big data bas√©e sur l'intelligence artificielle soit correcte et transparente. √Ä moins d'√©tablir un environnement √©thique, l'usage d'une telle analyse entra√Ænera probablement la prolif√©ration de syst√®mes de donn√©es non connect√©s, l'aggravation des in√©galit√©s actuelles ainsi qu'une perte de confiance et de fiabilit√©.,Los avances tecnol√≥gicos relativos a los macrodatos (es decir, grandes cantidades de datos muy variados de muchas fuentes diversas que pueden procesarse r√°pidamente), las ciencias de los datos y la inteligencia artificial pueden mejorar las funciones del sistema sanitario y promover la atenci√≥n personalizada y el bien p√∫blico. No obstante, estas tecnolog√≠as no sustituir√°n los componentes fundamentales del sistema sanitario, como el liderazgo √©tico y la gobernanza, ni evitar√°n la necesidad de un entorno √©tico y normativo s√≥lido. En el presente documento se examina c√≥mo podr√≠a ser un entorno √©tico y normativo s√≥lido para el an√°lisis de macrodatos en el √°mbito de los seguros m√©dicos, y se describen ejemplos de mecanismos de protecci√≥n y participaci√≥n que deber√≠an establecerse. En primer lugar, es fundamental contar con un marco claro y eficaz de gesti√≥n de datos. Es necesario promulgar normas jur√≠dicas y alentar e incentivar a las aseguradoras para que adopten un enfoque centrado en el ser humano en el dise√±o y la aplicaci√≥n de an√°lisis de macrodatos e inteligencia artificial. En segundo lugar, es necesario un proceso claro y responsable para explicar c√≥mo y qu√© informaci√≥n se puede utilizar. En tercer lugar, se debe facultar a las personas cuyos datos puedan ser utilizados mediante su participaci√≥n activa en la determinaci√≥n de c√≥mo se pueden gestionar y regular sus datos personales. En cuarto lugar, las aseguradoras y los √≥rganos de gobierno, incluidos los reguladores y los responsables de formular pol√≠ticas, deben colaborar para garantizar que los an√°lisis de macrodatos basados en la inteligencia artificial que se elaboren sean transparentes y precisos.

The structured nature of pathology data repositories makes it highly attractive to AI researchers to train deep learning models to improve health care delivery. Additionally, there are enormous financial incentives driving adoption of AI and ADM due to promise of increased efficiency of the health care delivery process. AI, if used unethically, may exacerbate existing inequities of health care, especially if not implemented correctly. There is an urgent need to harness the vast power of AI in an ethically and morally justifiable manner. This review explores the key issues involving AI ethics in pathology. Issues related to ethical design of pathology AI studies and the potential risks associated with implementation of AI and ADM within the pathology workflow are discussed. Three key foundational principles of ethical AI: transparency, accountability, and governance, are described in the context of pathology. The future practice of pathology must be guided by these principles. Pathologists should be aware of the potential of AI to deliver superlative health care and the ethical pitfalls associated with it.

In order to make the presence of robots safe as well as comfortable for humans, and to facilitate their acceptance in public environments, they are often equipped with social abilities for navigation and interaction. Socially compliant robot navigation is increasingly being learned from human observations or demonstrations. We argue that these techniques that typically aim to mimic human behavior do not guarantee fair behavior. As a consequence, social navigation models can replicate, promote, and amplify societal unfairness, such as discrimination and segregation. In this work, we investigate a framework for diminishing bias in social robot navigation models so that robots are equipped with the capability to plan as well as adapt their paths based on both physical and social demands. Our proposed framework consists of two components: learning which incorporates social context into the learning process to account for safety and comfort, and relearning to detect and correct potentially harmful outcomes before the onset. We provide both technological and societal analysis using three diverse case studies in different social scenarios of interaction. Moreover, we present ethical implications of deploying robots in social environments and propose potential solutions. Through this study, we highlight the importance and advocate for fairness in human-robot interactions in order to promote more equitable social relationships, roles, and dynamics and consequently positively influence our society.","social robot navigation, robot learning, fairness-aware learning, algorithmic fairness, ethics, responsible innovation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024571/,1,1,Germany,4,2021,18,0,-,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,algorithmic fairness; ethics; fairness-aware learning; responsible innovation; robot learning; social robot navigation.,0,Hispanic,Colombia,3,University of Freiburg,PhD,0,1,asian,India,4,University of Freiburg,PhD,0,,"Colombia, Colombia, India","3,3,2",3,3,3,1,1,University of Freiburg,BA,0,,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Colombia,Colombia,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['hispanic', 'hispanic', 'asian']",0,0,2,1,0,3,3,0,0%,

The research community of medical image computing is making great efforts in developing more accurate algorithms to assist medical doctors in the difficult task of disease diagnosis. However, little attention is paid to the way databases are collected and how this may influence the performance of AI systems. Our study sheds light on the importance of gender balance in medical imaging datasets used to train AI systems for computer-assisted diagnosis. We provide empirical evidence supported by a large-scale study, based on three deep neural network architectures and two well-known publicly available X-ray image datasets used to diagnose various thoracic diseases under different gender imbalance conditions. We found a consistent decrease in performance for underrepresented genders when a minimum balance is not fulfilled. This raises the alarm for national agencies in charge of regulating and approving computer-assisted diagnosis systems, which should include explicit gender balance and diversity recommendations.

The number of older adults is expected to increase to 98.5 million by 2060 with a 295% growth in foreign-born older adults, including Asian immigrants. Most older adults will have one or more chronic conditions and 95% of healthcare costs will be attributed to caring for these conditions. Among Asian Americans, common chronic conditions include respiratory disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pain. The National Institutes of Health, Institute on Aging, and National Science Foundation call for innovative technologies to be developed by multidisciplinary teams to address these concerns. Asian community leaders at Asian Health & Service Center and community members in Oregon identified the use of health-assistive technologies as a priority for potentially reducing stress and improving quality of life for both older adults and their caregivers. The purpose of this article is to introduce nurses and healthcare workers, advocating for the interests of Asian/Pacific Island community members, to the innovative health-assistive smart home. The health-assistive smart home uses artificial intelligence to identify and predict health events. Inclusion of minority persons' data in the development of artificial intelligence has been generally overlooked. This may result in continued health inequities and is incompatible with the goals of global health. Integration of minority voices while exploring the efficacious use of the health-assistive smart home is of significant value to minority populations. Asian immigrant older adults engaging in smart home research and development will enhance the cultural and technical safety of future devices. Asian families may be particularly interested in smart homes for extending independence because they place an emphasis on collective culture and family-based care. Community engagement of stakeholders and steadfast leadership are needed so that future technologies used in healthcare delivery are both technically and culturally sound. A community-engaged research approach promotes community empowerment that is responsive to community identified priorities and is a good fit for studying adoption of smart home monitoring for health-assistance.","Asians, immigrants, minorities, health-assistive smart homes, community-engaged research, technology, artificial intelligence",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484151/,1,0,USA,4,2018,7,1,Beta Psi Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International,Asian Pacific island nursing Journal,Asians; artificial intelligence; community-engaged research; health-assistive smart homes; immigrants; minorities; technology.,0,asian,USA,4,Washington State University,PhD,0,0,white,USA,4,Washington State University,PhD,0,,"USA, USA","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,Washington State University,"PhD, PhD","0, 0 ",,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'white']",1,0,0,1,0,2,2,0,50%,

However, the molecular bases for the survival disparity in breast cancer remain unclear, and no race-specific therapeutic targets have been proposed. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic analysis of the relationship between gene mRNA expression and clinical outcomes determined for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer patient cohort.,The systematic differential analysis of mRNA expression integrated with the analysis of clinical outcomes was performed for 1055 samples from the breast invasive carcinoma TCGA PanCancer cohorts. A deep learning fully-convolutional model was used to determine the association between gene expression and tumor features based on breast cancer patient histopathological images.,We found that more than 30% of all protein-coding genes are differentially expressed in White and African American breast cancer patients. We have determined a set of 32 genes whose overexpression in African American patients strongly correlates with decreased survival of African American but not White breast cancer patients. Among those genes, the overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) has one of the most dramatic and race-specific negative impacts on the survival of African American patients, specifically with triple-negative breast cancer. We found that MKK3 can promote the TNBC tumorigenesis in African American patients in part by activating of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by master regulator MYC.,The poor clinical outcomes in African American women with breast cancer can be associated with the abnormal elevation of individual gene expression.

By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, economic inequality enhanced the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The per capita hospital beds correlated negatively with COVID-19 deaths. Blood types B and AB were protective factors for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV and influenza and pneumonia was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Increased intake of vegetables, edible oil, protein, vitamin D, and vitamin K was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk, while increased intake of alcohol was associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included age, sex, temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, health investment, urbanization level, and race.

This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting.,In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients' residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients' residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study.,We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality.,In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD.

In this study, we automatically identify vulnerable older adult patients with geriatric syndrome based on clinical notes extracted from an EHR system, and demonstrate how contextual information can improve the process.,We propose a novel end-to-end neural architecture to identify sentences that contain geriatric syndromes. Our model learns a representation of the sentence and augments it with contextual information: surrounding sentences, the entire clinical document, and the diagnosis codes associated with the document. We trained our system on annotated notes from 85 patients, tuned the model on another 50 patients, and evaluated its performance on the rest, 50 patients.,Contextual information improved classification, with the most effective context coming from the surrounding sentences. At sentence level, our best performing model achieved a micro-F1 of 0.605, significantly outperforming context-free baselines. At patient level, our best model achieved a micro-F1 of 0.843.,Our solution can be used to expand the identification of vulnerable older adults with geriatric syndromes.

Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.",data assimilation; human mobility; neighborhood disparities; spatial epidemiology; stochastic COVID-19 spread modeling,https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2020524118,1,1,USA,4,2021,47,0,-,MedRxiv,"COVID-19, spatial epidemiology, social disparities, data assimilation ",0,asian,USA,4,University of Wisconsin-Madison,PhD,0,1,white,USA,4,University of Wisconsin-Madison,MD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",9,9,9,1,1,University of Wisconsin-Madison,"PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, Ms, PhD, PhD",0,,0,9,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'white', 'white']",2,0,0,7,0,9,9,0,22%,

Though some developed countries prepared guidelines for evaluation of LBP with tests to detect psychological overlay, implementation of the recommendations becomes quite difficult in regular clinical practice, and different specialties of medicine offer different modes of management. Aiming at offering an expert-level diagnosis for the patients having LBP, this paper uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to derive a clinically justified and highly sensitive LBP resolution technique.,The paper considers exhaustive knowledge for different LBP disorders (classified based on different pain generators), which have been represented using lattice structures to ensure completeness, non-redundancy, and optimality in the design of knowledge base. Further the representational enhancement of the knowledge has been done through construction of a hierarchical network, called RuleNet, using the concept of partially-ordered set (poset) with respect to the subset equality (‚äÜ) relation. With implicit incorporation of probability within the knowledge, the RuleNet is used to derive reliable resolution logic along with effective resolution of uncertainties during clinical decision making.,The proposed methodology has been validated with clinical records of seventy seven LBP patients accessed from the database of ESI Hospital Sealdah, India over a period of one year from 2018 to 2019. Achieving 83% sensitivity of the proposed technique, the pain experts at the hospital find the design clinically satisfactory. The inferred outcomes have also been found to be homogeneous with the actual or original diagnosis.,The proposed approach achieves the clinical and computational efficiency by limiting the shortcomings of the existing methodologies for AI-based LBP diagnosis. While computational efficiency (with respect to both time and space complexity) is ensured by inferring clinical decisions through optimal processing of the knowledge items using poset, the clinical acceptability has been ascertained reaching to the most-likely diagnostic outcomes through probabilistic resolution of clinical uncertainties.,The derived resolution technique, when embedded in LBP medical expert systems, would provide a fast, reliable, and affordable healthcare solution for this ailment to a wider range of general population suffering from LBP. The proposed scheme would significantly reduce the controversies and confusion in LBP treatment, and cut down the cost of unnecessary or inappropriate treatment and referral.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34629151/,1,1,India,2,2021,0,0,-,Artif Intell Med,Clinical uncertainty handling; Knowledge representation; Medical expert system; Partially ordered set; Probabilistic inference logic; Subgrouping of low back pain,0,asian,India,2,University of Kalyani,PhD,0,1,asian,India,2,Banaras University,Msc,0,,"India, India, India, India","2,2,2,2",4,4,4,1,1,"University of Kaylani, ESI Institue of Pain Managment, Banaras Hindu University ","PhD, PhD, Phd, Msc",0,,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,India,India,India,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian']",0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,0%,

Because diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients of these two groups show differences in their medical problems, the markers leading to ESRD are also expected to differ. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to compare their medical complications at various levels of kidney function and to identify markers that can be used to predict ESRD.,The data of type 2 diabetic patients was obtained from the 2012 Cerner database, which totaled 1,038,499 records. The data was then filtered to include only African American and Caucasian outpatients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), leaving 4,623 records. A priori machine learning was used to discover frequently appearing medical problems within the filtered data. CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure, present for >3 months.,This study found that African Americans have much higher rates of CKD-related medical problems than Caucasians for all five stages, and prominent markers leading to ESRD were discovered only for the African American group. These markers are high glucose, high systolic blood pressure (BP), obesity, alcohol/drug use, and low hematocrit. Additionally, the roles of systolic BP and diastolic BP vary depending on the CKD stage.,This research discovered frequently appearing medical problems across five stages of CKD and further showed that many of the markers reported in previous studies are more applicable to African American patients than Caucasian patients.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29181232/,1,1,USA,4,2017,5,0,0,Healthcare Informatics Research,race,0,asian,South Korea,4,"School of Library and Information Studies, University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, OK, USA",PhD,0,1,white,Turkey,3,"Spears School of Business, Oklahoma State University, Tulsa, OK, USA",PhD,0,,"Korean, India, Turkey","4, 2, 3",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, OK, USA; University of Oklahoma, Tulsa, OK, USA; Oklahoma State University, Tulsa, OK, USA","PhD, MD, PhD","0 ,0, 0",,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,South Korea,India,Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, white",1,0,0,2,0,3,3,0,33%,

This study used machine learning to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) from an urban academic medical center and to investigate whether providers' use of negative patient descriptors varied by patient race or ethnicity. We analyzed a sample of 40,113 history and physical notes (January 2019-October 2020) from 18,459 patients for sentences containing a negative descriptor (for example, resistant or noncompliant) of the patient or the patient's behavior. We used mixed effects logistic regression to determine the odds of finding at least one negative descriptor as a function of the patient's race or ethnicity, controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics. Compared with White patients, Black patients had 2.54 times the odds of having at least one negative descriptor in the history and physical notes.

This prejudice can bias face perception at the very beginning of social interaction. However, little is known about the neurocognitive mechanism underlying the influence of racial prejudice on facial emotion perception. Here, we examined the neural basis of disgust perception in racial prejudice using a passive viewing task and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that compared with the disgusted faces of in-groups, the disgusted faces of out-groups result in increased amygdala and insular engagement, positive coupling of the insula with amygdala-based emotional system, and negative coupling of the insula with anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-based regulatory system. Furthermore, machine-learning algorithms revealed that the level of implicit racial prejudice could be predicted by functional couplings of the insula with both the amygdala and the ACC, which suggests that the insula is largely involved in racially biased disgust perception through two distinct neural circuits. In addition, individual difference in disgust sensitivity was found to be predictive of implicit racial prejudice. Taken together, our results suggest a crucial role of insula-centered circuits for disgust perception in racial prejudice.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26417673/,1,1,None,None,2015,47,1,"National Natural Science Foundation of China; Contract grant numbers: 31300867, 81471376; Contract grant sponsor: National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Contract Grant number: 2014CB744600.",Human Brain Mapping,"race, prejude, brain-mapping, health conditions, neurological science",1,asian,China,3,Beijing Normal University,PhD,0,0,asian,China,3,"University of Groningen, Netherlands",PhD,0,,"China, China, China, China, China","3,3,3,3,3",5,5,5,1,1,"Beijing Normal University, China; Shenzhen University, China; University of Groningen, Netherlands","PhD, MD, PhD, PhD, PhD","0,0,0,0,0",,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,China,China,China,China,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, asian, asian, asian",0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,0%,

Three operational challenges with CAR-T therapy include the following: (1) the logistics of toxicity monitoring, ie, with frequent vital sign checks and neurologic assessments; (2) the specialized knowledge required for toxicity management, particularly with regard to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome; and (3) the need for high-quality symptomatic and supportive care during this intensive period. In this review, we explore potential niches for digital innovations that can improve the implementation of CAR-T therapy in each of these domains. These tools include patient-facing technologies and provider-facing platforms: for example, wearable devices and mobile health apps to screen for fevers and encephalopathy, electronic patient-reported outcome assessments-based workflows to assist with symptom management, machine learning algorithms to predict emerging CRS in real time, clinical decision support systems to assist with toxicity management, and digital coaching to help maintain wellness. Televisits, which have grown in prominence since the novel coronavirus pandemic, will continue to play a key role in the monitoring and management of CAR-T-related toxicities as well. Limitations of these strategies include the need to ensure care equity and stakeholder buy-in, both operationally and financially. Nevertheless, once developed and validated, the next-generation implementation of CAR-T therapy using these digital tools may improve both its safety and accessibility.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34110929/,1,1,USA,USA,2021,5,1,SparkCuresResearch Funding,JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics,"biocehmistry, immun system, race, gender",1,asian,India,2,"University of California San Francisco, USA",PhD,1,1,white,USA,4,"Jefferson University, Philadelphia,  USA",PhD,0,,"India, USA, USA","2, 4, 4",3,3,3,1,1,"University of California San Francisco, USA; University of California San Francisco, USA; Jefferson University, Philadelphia,  USA","PhD, MD, PhD","1,1,2000",,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,India,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, white",1,0,0,2,0,3,3,0,33%,

The general multiple mediation analysis method (MMA), proposed by Yu et al., improves traditional methods (e.g., estimation of natural and controlled direct effects) to enable consideration of multiple mediators/confounders simultaneously and the use of linear and nonlinear predictive models for estimating mediation/confounding effects. Previous studies find that compared with non-Hispanic cancer survivors, Hispanic survivors are more likely to endure anxiety and depression after cancer diagnoses. In this paper, we applied MMA on MY-Health study to identify mediators/confounders and quantify the indirect effect of each identified mediator/confounder in explaining ethnic disparities in anxiety and depression among cancer survivors who enrolled in the study. We considered a number of socio-demographic variables, tumor characteristics, and treatment factors as potential mediators/confounders and found that most of the ethnic differences in anxiety or depression between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white cancer survivors were explained by younger diagnosis age, lower education level, lower proportions of employment, less likely of being born in the USA, less insurance, and less social support among Hispanic patients.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29611093/,1,1,USA,4,2018,19,1,"NIMHD award # 1R15MD012387, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center",Psychometrika,"race, gender, health conditions, oncology, ethnic, disparity, ",0,asian,China,3,Louisiana State University,PhD,0,0,white,USA,4,Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center,PhD,0,,"China, USA, China, USA","3, 4, 3, 4",4,4,4,1,1,"Louisiana State University, USA; Med Star Health Institutes for Innovations, USA; Louisiana State University, USA; Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; USA, ","PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,China,USA,China,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, white, asian, white",2,0,0,2,0,4,4,0,50%,

The rates of perinatal health indicators such as maternal mortality and morbidity; fetal, neonatal, and infant mortality; low birthweight; and preterm birth have reduced over time. However, they are still a public health concern, and considerable disparities exist within and between countries. For perinatal researchers who are engaged in unraveling the tangled web of causation for maternal and child health outcomes and for clinicians involved in the care of pregnant women and infants, artificial intelligence offers novel approaches to prediction modeling, diagnosis, early detection, and monitoring in perinatal health. Machine learning, a commonly used artificial intelligence method, has been used to predict preterm birth, birthweight, preeclampsia, mortality, hypertensive disorders, and postpartum depression. Real-time electronic health recording and predictive modeling using artificial intelligence have found early success in fetal monitoring and monitoring of women with gestational diabetes especially in low-resource settings. Artificial intelligence-based methodologies have the potential to improve prenatal diagnosis of birth defects and outcomes in assisted reproductive technology too. In this scenario, we envision artificial intelligence for perinatal research to be based on three goals: (1) availability of population-representative, routine clinical data (rich multimodal data of large sample size) for perinatal research; (2) modification and application of current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for prediction and classification in health care research to the field of perinatal health; and (3) development of methods for explaining the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence models for perinatal health indicators. Achieving these three goals via a multidisciplinary approach to the development of artificial intelligence tools will enable trust in these tools and advance research, clinical practice, and policies to ensure optimal perinatal health.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34519596/,1,0,None,None,2021,9,0,0,Womens Health,perinatal health; preterm birth; severe maternal morbidity,0,asian,India,2,"University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.",PhD,0,1,asian,China,3,"Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China",PhD,0,,"india, india, china","3, 3, 3",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Oxford, University of Oxford, University of Guangzhou","PhD, MD, PhD, ","0, 0, 0",,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,india,india,china,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"asian, asian, asian",0,0,0,3,0,3,3,0,0%,

However, this literature lacks a systematic identification of the predictive power of SES as well as the possible non-linear relationships between the measures of SES (education, occupation, and material wealth) in predicting variation in women's height. This study aims to evaluate this predictive power. We used the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 66 low- and middle-income countries (women = 1,273,644), sampled between 1994 and 2016. The analysis consisted of training seven machine-learning algorithms of different function classes and assessing their predictive power out-of-sample, vis-√†-vis OLS regression. In an OLS framework, SES accounts for 0.7%, R2, of the total variance in women's height (from œÉOLSFix2 = 31.82 to œÉOLSSES2 = 31.57), adjusting for country, community, and sampling year fixed effects. The country-specific variances range from as low as 25.10 units in Egypt to as high as 74.46 units in Sao Tome and Principe. With the same set of SES measures, the best performing learner, a Bayesian neural net, produces a predictive variance of œÉBnnSES2 = 31.52. This is a negligible improvement in variance explained by 0.3% (œÉBnnSES2-œÉOLSSES2). Given our selection of algorithms, our findings indicate no relevant non-linear relationships between SES and women's height, and also the predictive limits of SES. We recommend that scholars report both the average effect of SES on health outcomes as well as its contribution to the variance explained.

Within the United States, various sociodemographic factors have played a role in the creation of regional disparities. Regional disparities have resulted in the unequal spread of disease between US counties, underscoring the need for efficient and accurate predictive modeling strategies to inform public health officials and reduce the burden on health care systems. Furthermore, despite the widespread accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines across the United States, vaccination rates have become stagnant, necessitating predictive modeling to identify important factors impacting vaccination uptake.,This study aims to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and vaccine uptake across counties in the United States.,Sociodemographic data on fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were sourced from several online databases such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Census Bureau COVID-19 Site.

In addition, it identified location, education, ethnicity, income, and household access to the internet as the most critical sociodemographic features in predicting vaccination uptake in US counties. Lastly, the model produced a choropleth demonstrating areas of low and high vaccination rates, which can be used by health care authorities in future pandemics to visualize and prioritize areas of low vaccination and design targeted vaccination campaigns.,Our study reveals that sociodemographic characteristics are predictors of vaccine uptake rates across counties in the United States and, if leveraged appropriately, can assist policy makers and public health officials to understand vaccine uptake rates and craft policies to improve them.",,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jude-Kong,1,1,Canada,4,2021,2,0,,Journal of medical internet research,"sociodemographic characteristics on vaccine uptake rates in the US, machine learning",0,asian,Canada,4,University of British columbia,Graduate student,0,0,black,Cameroon,4,University of New Jersey,PhD,0,,"Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Cameroon","4,4,4,4,1",5,5,5,1,1,University of british columbiaGraduate student,,0,,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Canada,Canada,Canada,Canada,Cameroon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'black']",0,1,0,4,0,5,5,0,0%,

To clarify the impact of race and ethnicity on late-stage melanoma diagnosis, we performed spatial analysis of geocoded melanoma cases diagnosed in Florida, 1999-2008, to identify geographic clusters of higher-than-expected incidence of late-stage melanoma and developed predictive models for melanoma cases in high-risk neighborhoods accounting for area-based poverty, race/ethnicity, patient insurance status, age, and gender. In the adjusted model, Hispanic ethnicity and census tract-level poverty are the strongest predictors for clustering of late-stage melanoma. Hispanic whites were 43% more likely to live in neighborhoods with excessive late-stage melanoma (P<0.001) compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHW). For every 1% increase in population living in poverty, there is a 2% increase in late-stage melanoma clustering (P<0.001).

The impact of insurance coverage varied among populations; the most consistent trend was that Medicaid coverage is associated with higher odds for late-stage melanoma.

A linear support vector machine classifier obtained an accuracy of 74.19% employing the features derived from resting-state brain networks to distinguish two groups of individuals with different punishment tendencies. Importantly, the most discriminative features that contributed to the classification were those regions frequently implicated in costly punishment decisions, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and putamen (salience network), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (mentalizing network), and lateral prefrontal cortex (central-executive network). These networks are previously implicated in encoding norm violation and intentions of others and integrating this information for punishment decisions. Our findings thus demonstrated that resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) provides a promising neuromarker of social preferences, and bolster the assertion that human costly punishment behaviors emerge from interactions among multiple neural systems.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306452218304111,1,1,China,3,2018,14,1,"National Postdoctoral

This increase in disease burden has been accompanied by pervasive health disparities associated with low disease detection rates, inadequate awareness, poor use of evidence-based interventions, and low adherence rates among patients in rural regions in India and those with low socioeconomic status. Several research groups in India have developed innovative technologies and care-delivery models for screening, diagnosis, clinical management, remote-monitoring, self-management, and rehabilitation for a range of chronic conditions. These innovations can leverage advances in sensor technology, genomic tools, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, and so on, for improving access to and delivering quality and affordable personalized medicine in primary care. In addition, several health technology start-ups are entering this booming market that is set to grow rapidly. Innovations outside biomedical space (eg, protection of traditional wisdom in diet, lifestyle, yoga) are equally important and are part of a comprehensive solution. Such low-cost, culturally tailored, robust innovations to promote health and reduce disparities require partnership among multi-sectors including academia, industry, civil society, and health systems operating in a conducive policy environment that fosters adequate public and private investments.

Methods: An electronic search of Web of Science (core database) had been conducted through use of an extensive search strategy comprising of keywords specific to the Arab region, EMRO countries, telehealth, medical conditions, and disorders. A total yield of 1,630 search results were processed, indexed through July 7, 2020. CiteSpace (5.7.R1, Drexel University, Pennsylvania, USA) is a Java-based application, a user-friendly tool for conducting scientometric analyses. Results: The present analyses found a lack of innovation in the field of digital health in the Arab countries. Many gaps in research were found in Arab countries, which will be discussed subsequently. Digital health research was clustered around themes of big data and artificial intelligence; a lack of progress was seen in telemedicine and digital health. Furthermore, only a small proportion of these publications had principal or corresponding authors from Arab countries. A clear disparity in digital health research in the Arab world was evident after comparing these insights with our previous investigation on telemedicine research in the global context.

","In the United States, racial disparities in birth outcomes persist and have been widening. Interpersonal and structural racism are leading explanations for the continuing racial disparities in birth outcomes, but research to confirm the role of racism and evaluate trends in the impact of racism on health outcomes has been hampered by the challenge of measuring racism. Most research on discrimination relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and few studies have examined racial attitudes and bias at the US national level.,This study aimed to investigate the associations between state-level Twitter-derived sentiments related to racial or ethnic minorities and birth outcomes.,We utilized Twitter's Streaming application programming interface to collect 26,027,740 tweets from June 2015 to December 2017, containing at least one race-related term. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine, a supervised machine learning model. We constructed overall indicators of sentiment toward minorities and sentiment toward race-specific groups. For each year, state-level Twitter-derived sentiment data were merged with birth data for that year. The study participants were women who had singleton births with no congenital abnormalities from 2015 to 2017 and for whom data were available on gestational age (n=9,988,030) or birth weight (n=9,985,402). The main outcomes were low birth weight (birth weight ‚â§2499 g) and preterm birth (gestational age <37 weeks). We estimated the incidence ratios controlling for individual-level maternal characteristics (sociodemographics, prenatal care, and health behaviors) and state-level demographics, using log binomial regression models.,The accuracy for identifying negative sentiments on comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. Mothers living in states in the highest tertile for negative sentiment tweets referencing racial or ethnic minorities had greater incidences of low birth weight (8% greater, 95% CI 4%-13%) and preterm birth (8% greater, 95% CI 0%-14%) compared with mothers living in states in the lowest tertile. More negative tweets referencing minorities were associated with adverse birth outcomes in the total population, including non-Hispanic white people and racial or ethnic minorities. In stratified subgroup analyses, more negative tweets referencing specific racial or ethnic minority groups (black people, Middle Eastern people, and Muslims) were associated with poor birth outcomes for black people and minorities.,A negative social context related to race was associated with poor birth outcomes for racial or ethnic minorities, as well as non-Hispanic white people.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32298232/,1,1,USA,1,2020,11,1,NIH,Jmir publications,birth outcomes; racial bias; racial or ethnic minorities; social media.,0,asian,USA,4,University of California,ScD,0,0,Asian,USA,4,University of Maryland School of Public Health,Phd,0,,"USA,USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4,4,4,4,4, 4",6,6,6,1,1,"University of California, University of Maryland, University of Maryland School of Public Health, University of California, UC Berkeley School of Public Health, University of Maryland School of Public Health","ScD, Phd, Phd, ScD, Phd, Phd","0,0,0,0,0,0",,0,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'black', 'asian', 'white', 'black', 'asian']",1,2,0,3,0,6,6,0,17%,

Among adults living with diabetes, those from ethnoracial minority communities-foreign-born, immigrant, refugee, and culturally marginalized-are at increased risk of poor health outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is actively being researched as a means of improving diabetes management and care; however, several factors may predispose AI to ethnoracial bias. To better understand whether diabetes AI interventions are being designed in an ethnoracially equitable manner, we conducted a secondary analysis of 141 articles included in a 2018 review by Contreras and Vehi entitled ""Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management and Decision Support: Literature Review."" Two members of our research team independently reviewed each article and selected those reporting ethnoracial data for further analysis. Only 10 articles (7.1%) were ultimately selected for secondary analysis in our case study. Of the 131 excluded articles, 118 (90.1%) failed to mention participants' ethnic or racial backgrounds. The included articles reported ethnoracial data under various categories, including race (n=6), ethnicity (n=2), race/ethnicity (n=3), and percentage of Caucasian participants (n=1). Among articles specifically reporting race, the average distribution was 69.5% White, 17.1% Black, and 3.7% Asian. Only 2 articles reported inclusion of Native American participants. Given the clear ethnic and racial differences in diabetes biomarkers, prevalence, and outcomes, the inclusion of ethnoracial training data is likely to improve the accuracy of predictive models. Such considerations are imperative in AI-based tools, which are predisposed to negative biases due to their black-box nature and proneness to distributional shift. Based on our findings, we propose a short questionnaire to assess ethnoracial equity in research describing AI-based diabetes interventions. At this unprecedented time in history, AI can either mitigate or exacerbate disparities in health care. Future accounts of the infancy of diabetes AI must reflect our early and decisive action to confront ethnoracial inequities before they are coded into our systems and perpetuate the very biases we aim to eliminate.

","Access to healthcare data such as electronic health records (EHR) is often restricted by laws established to protect patient privacy. These restrictions hinder the reproducibility of existing results based on private healthcare data and also limit new research. Synthetically-generated healthcare data solve this problem by preserving privacy and enabling researchers and policymakers to drive decisions and methods based on realistic data. Healthcare data can include information about multiple in- and out- patient visits of patients, making it a time-series dataset which is often influenced by protected attributes like age, gender, race etc. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health inequities, with certain subgroups experiencing poorer outcomes and less access to healthcare. To combat these inequities, synthetic data must ""fairly"" represent diverse minority subgroups such that the conclusions drawn on synthetic data are correct and the results can be generalized to real data. In this article, we develop two fairness metrics for synthetic data, and analyze all subgroups defined by protected attributes to analyze the bias in three published synthetic research datasets. These covariate-level disparity metrics revealed that synthetic data may not be representative at the univariate and multivariate subgroup-levels and thus, fairness should be addressed when developing data generation methods. We discuss the need for measuring fairness in synthetic healthcare data to enable the development of robust machine learning models to create more equitable synthetic healthcare datasets.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34573790/,1,1,,,2021,6,1,"United Health Foundation, the IBM AI Horizons Network,

Allegations of racism and sexism have permeated the conversation as stories surface about search engines delivering job postings for well-paying technical jobs to men and not women, or providing arrest mugshots when keywords such as ""black teenagers"" are entered. Learning algorithms are evolving; they are often created from parsing through large datasets of online information while having truth labels bestowed on them by crowd-sourced masses. These specialized AI algorithms have been liberated from the minds of researchers and startups, and released onto the public. Yet intelligent though they may be, these algorithms maintain some of the same biases that permeate society. They find patterns within datasets that reflect implicit biases and, in so doing, emphasize and reinforce these biases as global truth. This paper describes specific examples of how bias has infused itself into current AI and robotic systems, and how it may affect the future design of such systems. More specifically, we draw attention to how bias may affect the functioning of (1) a robot peacekeeper, (2) a self-driving car, and (3) a medical robot.

If the current trend continues, the burden of cancer is expected to increase to 22 million new cases annually by 2030, with 81% of new cases and almost 88% of mortality occurring in LMICs. Global health places a priority on improving health and reducing these disparities to achieve equity in health for all people worldwide. In today's hyper-connected world, information and communication technologies (ICTs) will increasingly play an integral role in global health.

While desirable bias may result from the explicit inclusion of sex or gender in diagnostic criteria of diseases with gender-based differences, undesirable biases can result from usage of datasets with an underrepresentation of certain groups. We believe that sex and gender differences should be taken into consideration in ML/AI algorithms in dermatology because there are important differences in the epidemiology and clinical presentation of dermatologic conditions including skin cancers, sex-specific cancers, and autoimmune conditions.

These individualized strategies encompass disease prevention, diagnosis, as well as treatment strategies. Today's healthcare workforce is faced with the availability of massive amounts of patient- and disease-related data. When mined effectively, these data will help produce more efficient and effective diagnoses and treatment, leading to better prognoses for patients at both the individual and population level. Designing preventive and therapeutic interventions for those patients who will benefit most while minimizing side effects and controlling healthcare costs, requires bringing diverse data sources together in an analytic paradigm. A resource to clinicians in the development and application of personalized medicine is largely facilitated, perhaps even driven, by the analysis of ""big data"". For example, the availability of clinical data warehouses is a significant resource for clinicians in practicing personalized medicine. These ""big data"" repositories can be queried by clinicians, using specific questions, with data used to gain an understanding of challenges in patient care and treatment. Health informaticians are critical partners to data analytics including the use of technological infrastructures and predictive data mining strategies to access data from multiple sources, assisting clinicians' interpretation of data and development of personalized, targeted therapy recommendations. In this paper, we look at the concept of personalized medicine, offering perspectives in four important, influencing topics: 1) the availability of 'big data' and the role of biomedical informatics in personalized medicine, 2) the need for interdisciplinary teams in the development and evaluation of personalized therapeutic approaches, and 3) the impact of electronic medical record systems and clinical data warehouses on the field of personalized medicine.

We criticize recent attempts to identify the explanation of black box algorithms with making their decisions (post-hoc) interpretable, focusing our discussion on counterfactual explanations. These approaches to explanation simplify the real nature of the black boxes and risk misleading the public about the normative features of a model. We propose a new form of algorithmic transparency, that consists in explaining algorithms as an intentional product, that serves a particular goal, or multiple goals (Daniel Dennet's design stance) in a given domain of applicability, and that provides a measure of the extent to which such a goal is achieved, and evidence about the way that measure has been reached. We call such idea of algorithmic transparency ""design publicity."" We argue that design publicity can be more easily linked with the justification of the use and of the design of the algorithm, and of each individual decision following from it. In comparison to post-hoc explanations of individual algorithmic decisions, design publicity meets a different demand (the demand for impersonal justification) of the explainee. Finally, we argue that when models that pursue justifiable goals (which may include fairness as avoidance of bias towards specific groups) to a justifiable degree are used consistently, the resulting decisions are all justified even if some of them are (unavoidably) based on incorrect predictions. For this argument, we rely on John Rawls's idea of procedural justice applied to algorithms conceived as institutions.",Cognitive science; Computing methodologies ~ Artificial intelligence; Concepts and models; Explanations; Human-centered computing ~ HCI theory; Justifications; Machine learning; Machine learning; Philosophy of science; Transparency.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867077/,1,0,,,2021,25,1,University of Zurich,Ethics and Information Technology volume,"machine learning, design publicity",1,white,Italy,4,University of Colorado,MD,0,0,white,Italy,4,University of Zurich,PhD,0,,"Italy, Italy, Italy","4, 4, 4",3,3,3,1,1,"University of Colorado, University of  Zurich, University of Zurich","MD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0",,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Italy,Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"white, white, white",3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,100%,

Cancellation is reported to impact between 2% and 20% of the 50 million procedures performed annually in American hospitals. Up to 85% of cancellations may be amenable to the modification of patients' and families' behaviors. However, the factors underlying DoSC and the barriers experienced by families are not well understood.,This study aims to conduct a geospatial analysis of patient-specific variables from electronic health records (EHRs) of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and of Texas Children's Hospital (TCH), as well as linked socioeconomic factors measured at the census tract level, to understand potential underlying contributors to disparities in DoSC rates across neighborhoods.,The study population included pediatric patients who underwent scheduled surgeries at CCHMC and TCH. A 5-year data set was extracted from the CCHMC EHR, and addresses were geocoded. An equivalent set of data >5.7 years was extracted from the TCH EHR. Case-based data related to patients' health care use were aggregated at the census tract level. Community-level variables were extracted from the American Community Survey as surrogates for patients' socioeconomic and minority status as well as markers of the surrounding context. Leveraging the selected variables, we built spatial models to understand the variation in DoSC rates across census tracts. The findings were compared to those of the nonspatial regression and deep learning models. Model performance was evaluated from the root mean squared error (RMSE) using nested 10-fold cross-validation. Feature importance was evaluated by computing the increment of the RMSE when a single variable was shuffled within the data set.,Data collection yielded sets of 463 census tracts at CCHMC (DoSC rates 1.2%-12.5%) and 1024 census tracts at TCH (DoSC rates 3%-12.2%). For CCHMC, an L2-normalized generalized linear regression model achieved the best performance in predicting all-cause DoSC rate (RMSE 1.299%, 95% CI 1.21%-1.387%); however, its improvement over others was marginal. For TCH, an L2-normalized generalized linear regression model also performed best (RMSE 1.305%, 95% CI 1.257%-1.352%). All-cause DoSC rate at CCHMC was predicted most strongly by previous no show. As for community-level data, the proportion of African American inhabitants per census tract was consistently an important predictor. In the Texas area, the proportion of overcrowded households was salient to DoSC rate.,Our findings suggest that geospatial analysis offers potential for use in targeting interventions for census tracts at a higher risk of cancellation. Our study also demonstrates the importance of home location, socioeconomic disadvantage, and racial minority status on the DoSC of children's surgery. The success of future efforts to reduce cancellation may benefit from taking social, economic, and cultural issues into account.",Social determinants of health,https://en.x-mol.com/paper/article/1436372486387986432,1,1,USA,4,2021,1,0,,J Med Internet Res,"Machine learning, pregnancy, antenatal care, wealth, literacy, India, poor, illiterate, Muslim",1,Asian,China,3,University of Cincinnati,PhD,0,1,Asian,UK,4,Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania,MBBA,0,,"China, China, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, UK","3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4",8,8,8,1,1,"University of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati, Texas Children's Hospital,  University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati","PhD, PhD, MD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, MBBA","0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0",,0,8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,China,China,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,UK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asian, asian, white, white, Asian, white, Asian, asian",3,0,0,5,0,8,8,0,38%,

IRB review and approval for the current analyses was obtained from University of California, San Diego. Cross-sectional data were collected from women with children aged 0-11 months (n = 5,565) from rural households in 25 districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Participants were surveyed on maternal healthcare utilization including registration of pregnancy (model-1), receipt of antenatal care (ANC) during pregnancy (model-2), and delivery at health facilities (model -3). Social determinants of health including wealth, social group, literacy, religion, and early age at marriage were captured during the survey. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was used to explore intersections of social determinants of healthcare utilization.,CART analyses highlight the intersections, particularly of wealth and literacy, in maternal healthcare utilization in Uttar Pradesh. Model-1 documents that women who are poorer, illiterate and Muslim are less likely to have their pregnancies registered (71.4% vs. 86.0% in the overall sample). Model-2 documents that poorer, illiterate women had the lowest ANC coverage (37.7% vs 45% in the overall sample). Model-3, developed for deliveries at health facilities, highlighted that illiterate and poor women have the lowest representation among facility deliveries (59.6% vs. 69% in the overall sample).,This paper explores the interactions between determinants of maternal healthcare utilization indicators. The findings in this paper highlights that the interaction of wealth and literacy can play a very strong role in accentuating or diminishing healthcare utilization among women. The study also reveals that religion and women's age at marriage also interact with wealth and literacy to create substantial disparities in utilization. The study provides insights into the effect of intersections of determinants, and highlights the importance of using a more nuanced understanding of the impact of co-occurring forms of marginalization to effectively tackle inequities in healthcare utilization.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6171889/,1,1,India,2,2018,26,1,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Sambodhi Research and Communications Pvt.

The objectives of this study were to investigate season- and race-specific disparities for asthma risk, and to identify environmental exposure variables associated with ED visits among more than 42,000 individuals of African American (AA) and European American (EA) descent identified through electronic health records (EHRs).,We examined data from 42,375 individuals (AAs = 14,491, EAs = 27,884) identified in EHRs. We considered associated demographic (race, age, gender, insurance), clinical (smoking status, ED visits, FEV1%), and environmental exposures data (mold, pollen, and pollutants). Machine learning techniques, including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and decision tree (DT) were used to build and identify race- and -season-specific predictive models for asthma ED visits.,Significant differences in ED visits and FEV1% among AAs and EAs were identified. ED visits by AAs was 32.0% higher than EAs and AAs had 6.4% lower FEV1% value than EAs. XGB model was used to accurately classify asthma patients visiting ED into AAs and EAs. Pollen factor and pollution (PM2.5, PM10) were the key variables for asthma in AAs and EAs, respectively. Age and cigarette smoking increase asthma risk independent of seasons.,In this study, we observed racial and season-specific disparities between AAs and EAs asthmatics for ED visit and FEV1% severity, suggesting the need to address asthma disparities through key predictors including socio-economic status, particulate matter, and mold.",EHR; Race disparities; electronic healthcare records; machine learning; seasonal variation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33112174/,1,1,USA,4,2022,2,0,,J Asthma,"AI, racial disparities, asthma, computer assisted diagnosis",1,Black,USA,4,University of Cincinnati,PhD,0,1,Black,Ethiopia,1,University of Cincinnati,PhD,0,,"USA, India, USA, Ethiopia","4, 2, 4, 1",4,4,4,1,1,"University of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati","PhD, PhD, BA, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,India,USA,Ethiopia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Black, asian, white, black",1,2,0,1,0,4,4,0,25%,

However, there are concerns right from the data acquisition, bias in data, difficulty in comparing between different algorithm, challenges in machine learning, its application in different group of population, and human barrier to AI adoption in health care. There are also legal and ethical concerns related to AI. The tension between risks and concerns on one hand versus potential and opportunity on the other have driven a need for authorities to implement policies for AI in DR screening to address these issues. The policy makers should support and facilitate research and development of AI in healthcare, but at the same time, it has to be ensured that the use of AI in healthcare aligns with recognized standards of safety, efficacy, and equity. It is essential to ensure that algorithms, datasets, and decisions are auditable and when applied to medical care (such as screening, diagnosis, or treatment) are clinically validated and explainable. Policy frameworks should require design of AI systems in health care that are informed by real-world workflow and human-centric design.

In Step 1, we trained a classification model that gives the probability of waiting (1 day or more). In Step 2, we identified subgroups with a higher probability of differences due to race. We tested three classification models for Step 1 and identified the model with the best estimation.,Client data were collected by states during personal interviews at admission and discharge.,Random forest was the most accurate model for the first step of subgroup analysis. We found large variation across states in racial disparities. Stratified analysis of two states with the largest samples showed critical factors that augmented disparities beyond race. In California, factors such as service setting, referral source, and homelessness defined the subgroup most vulnerable to racial disparities. In Maryland, service setting, prior episodes, receipt of medication-assisted opioid treatment, and primary drug use frequency augmented disparities beyond race. The identified subgroups had significantly larger racial disparities.,The methodology used in this study enabled a nuanced understanding of the complexities in disparities research. We found state and service factors that intersected with race and augmented disparities in wait time.

Moreover, very few studies have investigated exposure disparity in terms of individual-level data or at multi-temporal scales.,This work aims to examine the associations between individual- and neighbourhood-level economic statuses and individual exposure to PM2.5 across multi-temporal scales.,The study population included 742,220 mobile phone users on a weekday in Shenzhen, China. A geo-informed backward propagation neural network model was developed to estimate hourly PM2.5 concentrations by the use of remote sensing and geospatial big data, which were then combined with individual trajectories to estimate individual total exposure during weekdays at multi-temporal scales. Coupling the estimated PM2.5 exposure with housing price, we examined the associations between individual- and neighbourhood-level economic statuses and individual exposure using linear regression and two-level hierarchical linear models. Furthermore, we performed five sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the two-level effects.,We found positive associations between individual- and neighbourhood-level economic statuses and individual PM2.5 exposure at a daytime, daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal or annual scale. Findings on the effects of the two-level economic statuses were generally robust in the five sensitivity analyses. In particular, despite the insignificant effects observed in three of newly selected time periods in the sensitivity analysis, individual- and neighbourhood-level economic statuses were still positively associated with individual total exposure during each of other newly selected periods (including three other seasons).,There are statistically positive associations of individual PM2.5 exposure with individual- and neighbourhood-level economic statuses. That is, people living in areas with higher residential property prices are more exposed to PM2.5 pollution.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models promise to detect psychopathology in natural language, but they have been evaluated primarily in non-clinical settings using social media. This study sought to test the ability of AI-based language assessments to predict PTSD symptom trajectories among responders.,Participants were 124 responders whose health was monitored at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program who completed oral history interviews about their initial WTC experiences. PTSD symptom severity was measured longitudinally using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) for up to 7 years post-interview. AI-based indicators were computed for depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and extraversion along with dictionary-based measures of linguistic and interpersonal style. Linear regression and multilevel models estimated associations of AI indicators with concurrent and subsequent PTSD symptom severity (significance adjusted by false discovery rate).,Cross-sectionally, greater depressive language (Œ≤ = 0.32; p = 0.049) and first-person singular usage (Œ≤ = 0.31; p = 0.049) were associated with increased symptom severity. Longitudinally, anxious language predicted future worsening in PCL scores (Œ≤ = 0.30; p = 0.049), whereas first-person plural usage (Œ≤ = -0.36; p = 0.014) and longer words usage (Œ≤ = -0.35; p = 0.014) predicted improvement.,This is the first study to demonstrate the value of AI in understanding PTSD in a vulnerable population.

This article reviews the global epidemiology of PH, with emphasis on the prevalence, causes, forms, and underlying factors in the developing world. Left ventricular heart disease is the most common cause worldwide, but the main contributors in developing countries are chronic infectious diseases, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and rheumatic heart disease. Despite data suggesting a high prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa, the available literature is very limited. International registries like the Pan African Pulmonary Hypertension Cohort are essential to provide information about the causes, comorbidities, and diagnostic classification, therapeutic management, and the natural course of PH worldwide. Moreover, there is a need to track diagnostic and management practices and challenges to identify the gaps and gradients between different regions of the world. The information gained will pinpoint areas for improvement, aiming at bridging the current divide between low-income and high-income countries.","['alkaloid', 'brain natriuretic peptide', 'carbon monoxide', 'pyrrolizidine alkaloid', 'tryptophan', 'Africa south of the Sahara', 'air pollution', 'altitude', 'cardiomyopathy', 'chronic obstructive lung disease', 'chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension', 'combustion', 'comorbidity', 'developing country', 'diastolic dysfunction', 'Eisenmenger complex', 'environmental change', 'environmental factor', 'follow up', 'geographic distribution', 'health care access', 'heart disease', 'cardiac index', 'heart muscle fibrosis', 'heart right atrium pressure', 'heredity', 'human', 'infection', 'interstitial lung disease', 'lung diffusion capacity', 'lung function', 'mining', 'mitral valve disease', 'mortality', 'prevalence', 'prognosis', 'pulmonary hypertension', 'Raynaud phenomenon', 'review', 'rheumatic heart disease', 'risk factor', 'schistosomiasis', 'sickle cell anemia', 'socioeconomics', 'survival rate', 'survival time', 'thromboembolism', 'traditional medicine']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2015.01.030,1,1,South Africa,3,2015,49,0,,Can J Cardiol,"global epidemiology, pulmonary hypertension",0,black,Mozambique,1,Universidade Eduardo Mondlane,MD,1,0,white,Germany,3,University of Cape Town,MD,1,,"Mozambique, Germany, Germany","1,4,3",3,3,3,1,1,University of Cape Town,MD,1,,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mozambique,Germany,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"black, white, white",2,1,0,0,0,3,3,0,67%,

Although some studies have utilized it to analyze the relationship between chemicals and human health effects, fewer have used this technique to identify and quantify associations between environmental and social stressors. Socio-demographic variables were generated based on U.S. Census tract-level income, race/ethnicity population percentage, education level, and age information from the 2010-2014, 5-Year Summary files in the American Community Survey (ACS) database, and chemical variables were generated by utilizing the 2011 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) census tract-level air pollutant exposure concentration data. Six mobile- and industrial-source pollutants were chosen for analysis, including acetaldehyde, benzene, cyanide, particulate matter components of diesel engine emissions (namely, diesel PM), toluene, and 1,3-butadiene. ARM was then applied to quantify and visualize the associations between the chemical and socio-demographic variables. Census tracts with a high percentage of racial/ethnic minorities and populations with low income tended to have higher estimated chemical exposure concentrations (fourth quartile), especially for diesel PM, 1,3-butadiene, and toluene. In contrast, census tracts with an average population age of 40-50 years, a low percentage of racial/ethnic minorities, and moderate-income levels were more likely to have lower estimated chemical exposure concentrations (first quartile).

We applied these techniques to > 400,000 patients‚Äô and physicians‚Äô secure messages (SMs) exchanged via an electronic patient portal, developing and validating an automated patient literacy profile (LP) and physician complexity profile (CP). Herein, we describe the challenges faced and the solutions implemented during this innovative endeavor. Materials and methods: To describe challenges and solutions, we used two data sources: study documents and interviews with study investigators. Over the five years of the project, the team tracked their research process using a combination of Google Docs tools and an online team organization, tracking, and management tool (Asana). In year 5, the team convened a number of times to discuss, categorize, and code primary challenges and solutions. Results: We identified 23 challenges and associated approaches that emerged from three overarching process domains: (1) Data Mining related to the SM corpus; (2) Analyses using NLP indices on the SM corpus; and (3) Interdisciplinary Collaboration. With respect to Data Mining, problems included cleaning SMs to enable analyses, removing hidden caregiver proxies (e.g., other family members) and Spanish language SMs, and culling SMs to ensure that only patients‚Äô primary care physicians were included. With respect to Analyses, critical decisions needed to be made as to which computational linguistic indices and ML approaches should be selected; how to enable the NLP-based linguistic indices tools to run smoothly and to extract meaningful data from a large corpus of medical text; and how to best assess content and predictive validities of both the LP and the CP. With respect to the Interdisciplinary Collaboration, because the research required engagement between clinicians, health services researchers, biomedical informaticians, linguists, and cognitive scientists, continual effort was needed to identify and reconcile differences in scientific terminologies and resolve confusion; arrive at common understanding of tasks that needed to be completed and priorities therein; reach compromises regarding what represents ‚Äúmeaningful findings‚Äù in health services vs. cognitive science research; and address constraints regarding potential transportability of the final LP and CP to different health care settings. Discussion: Our study represents a process evaluation of an innovative research initiative to harness ‚Äúbig linguistic data‚Äù to estimate patient HL and physician linguistic complexity. Any of the challenges we identified, if left unaddressed, would have either rendered impossible the effort to generate LPs and CPs, or invalidated analytic results related to the LPs and CPs. Investigators undertaking similar research in HL or using computational linguistic methods to assess patient-clinician exchange will face similar challenges and may find our solutions helpful when designing and executing their health communications research.","['caregiver', 'controlled study', 'decision making', 'discriminant analysis', 'doctor patient relationship', 'documentation', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'human', 'interview', 'linguistics', 'machine learning', 'natural language processing', 'note', 'organization', 'priority journal', 'self report', 'support vector machine', 'task performance', 'writing', 'writing complexity']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103658,1,1,USA,4,2021,2,1,National Library of Medicine,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,"natural language processing, machine learning, patients’ health literacy, physician writing complexity",1,black,USA,4,University of San Francisco,"PhD, Dr.P.H.",1,1,white,USA,4,University of California San Francisco,MD,1,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4",12,12,12,1,1,"University of California San Francisco, Arizona State, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Georgia State University, University of California San Francisco, Arizona State, University of California San Francisco, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, University of California San Francisco, Arizona State University, University of California San Francisco","PhD, Dr.P.H., PhD, PhD, PhD, MD, PhD, PhD, DPT, MPH, MPH, PhD, MD","0, 1, 0, 0 1, 0, 0, 0 , 0 ,0, 0",,0,12,12,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['black', 'asian', 'white', 'white','black, 'hispanic', 'white', 'asian', 'white', 'black', 'white', 'white']",6,3,1,2,0,12,12,0,50%,

","This paper shows the concurrent use of thermography and artificial neural networks (ANN) for the diagnosis of breast cancer, a disease that is growing in prominence in women all over the world. It has been reported that breast thermography itself could detect breast cancer up to 10 years earlier than the conventional golden methods such as mammography, in particular in the younger patient. However, the accuracy of thermography is dependent on many factors such as the symmetry of the breasts' temperature and temperature stability. A woman's body temperature is known to be stable in certain periods after menstruation and it was found that the accuracy of thermography in women whose thermal images are taken in a suitable period (5th - 12th and 21st day of menstruation) is higher (80%) than the total population of patients (73%). The stability of the body temperature will depend on physiological state. This paper examines the use of ANN to complement the infrared heat radiating from the surface of the body with other physiological data. Four backpropagation neural networks were developed and trained using the results from the Singapore General Hospital patients' physiological data and thermographs. Owing to the inaccuracies found in thermography and the low population size gathered for this project, the networks developed could only accurately diagnose about 61.54% of the breast cancer cases. Nevertheless, the basic neural network framework has been established and it has great potential for future development of an intelligent breast cancer diagnosis system. This would be especially useful to the teenagers and young adults who are unsuitable for mammography at a young age. An intelligent breast thermography-neural network will be able to give an accurate diagnosis of breast cancer and can make a positive impact on breast disease detection.",https://doi.org/10.1080%2F03091900210146941,1,1,Singapore,4,2002,107,0,,Journal of Medical Engineering & Technology,"AI, detection, breast cancer",1,asian,Singapore,4,"School of Mechanical and Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological University",PhD,0,1,asian,Singapore,4,Singapore General Hospital,-,0,,"Singapore, kazakhstan, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","4,3,4, 4, 4",5,5,5,1,1,"Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital","PhD, Phd, N/A, MD, N/A","0, 0, 0, 0",,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Singapore,kazakhstan,Singapore,Singapore,Singapore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'asian', 'white']",1,0,0,4,0,5,5,0,20%,

Numerous examples of deep learning achieving expert-level performance in specific tasks in all four categories have been demonstrated in the past few years, although comprehensive interpretation of imaging examinations has not yet been achieved. It is important for the practicing musculoskeletal radiologist to understand the current scope of deep learning as it relates to musculoskeletal radiology.

The casemix approach to health care funding is expected to yield significant benefits, including equity and rationality in financing health care, the use of comparative casemix data for quality improvement activities, and the provision of information that enables hospitals to understand their cost behaviour and reinforces the drive for more cost-efficient services. However, there is some concern about the ""quicker and sicker"" syndrome (that is, the rapid discharge of patients with little regard for the quality of outcome). As it is likely that consequences of premature discharges will be reflected in the readmission data, an analysis of possible systematic patterns in readmission data can provide useful insight into the ""quicker and sicker"" syndrome. This paper explores potential data mining applications in the context of casemix by using readmission data as an illustration. In particular, it illustrates how data mining can be used to better understand readmission data and to detect systematic patterns, if any. From a technical perspective, data mining (which is capable of analysing complex non-linear and interaction relationships) supplements and complements traditional statistical methods in data analysis. From an applications perspective, data mining provides the technology and methodology to analyse mass volume of data to detect hidden patterns in data. Using readmission data as an illustrative data mining application, this paper explores potential data mining applications in the general casemix context.","['article', 'artificial neural network', 'cluster analysis', 'decision support system', 'diagnosis related group', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization', 'human', 'patient care', 'statistical analysis', 'statistics']",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11721278/,1,1,Singapore,4,2020,2,0,,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore https://europepmc.org/article/med/11721278 ","Data mining, case mix",0,asian,Singapore,4,Nanyang Technological University,MBBS,0,1,asian,Singapore,4,National University of Singapore,MS,0,,"Singapore, Singapore","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,"Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore","MBBS, MS","0, 0",,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Singapore,Singapore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'asian']",0,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,0%,

It has the potential to enhance executive information systems. Such enhancement would mean better decision-making by management, which in turn would mean better services for customers. While the future of data mining as technology should be exciting, some are worried about privacy concerns, which make the future of data mining daunting. This paper examines why data mining is highly profiled - the imperative toward data mining, data mining models and processes. Additionally, the paper examines some of the benefits and challenges of using data mining processes within the health-care arena. We cast the future of data mining by highlighting two of the many data mining tools available - one commercial and one freely available. Subsequently, we discuss a number of social and technical factors that may thwart the extensive deployment of data mining, especially when the intent is to know more about the people that organizations have to serve and cast a view of what the future holds for data mining. This component is especially important when attempting to determine the longevity of data mining within health-care organizations. It is hoped that our discussions would be useful to organizations as they engage data mining, strategies for executive information systems and information policy issues.","['data mining', 'decision making', 'health care', 'health care organization', 'health care policy', 'health care utilization', 'information system', 'organization and management', 'priority journal', 'review']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1258/hsmr.2009.009029,1,0,USA,4,2010,15,0,,SAGE journals https://journals-sagepub-com.meharry.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1258/hsmr.2009.009029,"Data mining, health executive decision support",0,black,USA,4,University of South Carolina,PhD,0,0,black,USA,4,University of South Carolina,PhD,0,,"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA","4, 4, 4, 4, 4",5,5,5,1,1,"University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Southern Illinois University, University of South Carolina, ","PhD, PhD, PhD, BS, PhD, ","0, 0, 0, 0, 0",,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,USA,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['black', 'white', 'white', 'black', 'black']",2,3,0,0,0,5,5,0,40%,

Therefore, no target variable exists for the classification approaches to learn from or train with. The problem of identifying the potential recipients of telehealth services when introducing telehealth services into health welfare or health insurance schemes becomes an unsupervised classification problem without a target variable.,We propose a HDTTCA approach, which is a systematic approach (the main process of HDTTCA involves (1) data set preprocessing, (2) decision tree model building, and (3) predicting and explaining of the most important attributes in the data set for patients who qualify for telehealth service) to identify those who are eligible for telehealth services.,This work uses data from the NHIRD provided by the NHIA in Taiwan in 2012 as our research scope, which consist of 55,389 distinct hospitals and 653,209 distinct patients with 15,882,153 outpatient and 135,775 inpatient records. After HDTTCA produces the final version of the decision tree, the rules can be used to assign the values of the target variables in the entire NHIRD. Our data indicate that 3.56% (23,262 out of 653,209) of the patients are eligible for telehealth services in 2012. This study verifies the efficiency and validity of HDTTCA by using a large data set from the NHI of Taiwan.,This study conducts a series of experiments 30 times to compare the HDTTCA results with the logistic regression findings by measuring their average performance and determining which model addresses the telehealth patient classification problem better. Four important metrics are used to compare the results. In terms of sensitivity, the decision trees generated by HDTTCA and the logistic regression model are on equal grounds. In terms of accuracy, specificity, and precision, the decision tree generated by HDTTCA provides a better performance than that of the logistic regression model. When HDTTCA is applied, the decision tree model generates a competitive performance and provides clear, easily understandable rules.

Using text mining, we identified 20,678 HIV-related federal projects from 2008 to 2018 in NIH ExPORTER, which were then integrated with data from AtlasPlus and US Census Bureau. We developed Gini coefficients to assess the inequality of funding and the Generalized Estimating Equations model to examine the associations between funding allocation and (1) state HIV disease burden, (2) state research capacity, and (3) geographic regions, respectively. The Gini coefficients (0.60 to 0.80) suggest a highly skewed funding distribution. Funding allocation was not associated with state HIV disease burden (p = 0.269) but HIV research capacity (p = 0.000). The South (with the heaviest HIV disease burden) did not receive significantly more federal funding. Our findings for the first time identified disparities of federal funding allocation, suggesting that federal agencies favor states of high research capacity over heavy disease burden, which may reinforce the HIV-related health disparities.","['article', 'big data', 'controlled study', 'disease burden', 'exploratory research', 'funding', 'health care disparity', 'human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus', 'Human immunodeficiency virus infection', 'mining', 'nonhuman', 'United States']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2021.1896664,1,1,USA,4,2021,2,0,,Diabetes Care Journal https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/36/7/1815/33210/Mind-the-Gap-Disparity-Between-Research-Funding,"Disparity, funding, Costs of Care for Diabetic Foot Ulcers",1,asian,China,3,University of South Carolina,PhD,0,1,asian,China,3,University of South Carolina,PhD,0,,"China, China, USA, China, China","3,3,4,3,3",5,5,5,1,1,"University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina, University of South Carolina,  ","PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD, PhD","0, 0, 0, 0, 0",,0,5,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,China,China,USA,China,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'asian', 'white', 'asian', 'asian']",1,0,0,4,0,5,5,0,20%,

Our study will provide essential knowledge for clinical researchers to further investigate comorbidities and disease progression for improving the management of multiple diseases. We used inpatient discharge and outpatient visit records from the New York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) from 2011-2015. We grouped each patient's visit history to generate diagnosis sequences for seven most popular cancer types. We performed frequent disease co-occurrence mining using the Apriori algorithm, and frequent disease sequence patterns discovery using the cSPADE algorithm. Different types of cancer demonstrated distinct patterns. Disparities of both disease co-occurrence and sequence patterns were observed from patients within different age groups. There were also considerable disparities in disease co-occurrence patterns with respect to different claim types (i.e., inpatient, outpatient, emergency department and ambulatory surgery). Disparities regarding genders were mostly found where the cancer types were gender specific. Supports of most patterns were usually higher for males than for females. Compared with secondary diagnosis codes, primary diagnosis codes can convey more stable results. Two disease sequences consisting of the same diagnoses but in different orders were usually with different supports. Our results suggest that the methods adopted can generate potentially interesting and clinically meaningful disease co-occurrence and sequence patterns, and identify disparities among various patient groups.

Broken Hill is Australia's oldest operating silver-zinc-lead mine. In this study, we utilized recent advances in machine learning to assess multiple algorithms and identify the most optimal model for predicting childhood blood Pb levels (BLL) using Broken Hill children's (<5 years of age) data (n = 23,749) from 1991 to 2015, combined with demographic, socio-economic, and environmental influencing factors. We applied model-agnostic methods to interpret the most optimal model, investigating different environmental and human factors influencing childhood BLL. Algorithm assessment showed that stacked ensemble, a method for automatically and optimally combining multiple prediction algorithms, enhanced predictive performance by 1.1% with respect to mean absolute error (p < 0.01) and 2.6% for root-mean-squared error (p < 0.01) compared to the best performing constituent algorithm (random forest). By interpreting the model, the following information was acquired: children had higher BLL if they resided within 1.0 km to the central mine area or 1.37 km to the railroad; year of testing had the greatest interactive strength with all other factors; BLL increased faster in Aboriginal than in non-Aboriginal children at 9-10 and 12-18 months of age. This ""stacked ensemble + model-agnostic interpretation"" framework achieved both prediction accuracy and model interpretability, identifying previously unconnected variables associated with elevated childhood BLL, offering a marked advantage over previous works. Thus, this approach has a clear value and potential for application to other environmental health issues.","['lead', 'age', 'age distribution', 'article', 'child', 'child health', 'controlled study', 'cross validation', 'data correlation', 'environmental factor', 'environmental health', 'ethnic difference', 'feature ranking', 'geographic distribution', 'home environment', 'human', 'infant', 'intermethod comparison', 'lead blood level', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning', 'measurement accuracy', 'measurement error', 'mining', 'prediction', 'predictive value', 'railway', 'seasonal variation', 'sex factor', 'social status', 'soil chemistry', 'stacked autoencoder', 'statistical model', 'time factor']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c01097,1,1,Austrailia,4,2021,7,1,International Cotutelle Macquarie University Research Training Program,,Environmental Science and Technology,1,asian,China,4,China University of Geosciences,PhD,0,0,asian,China,3,Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine,PhD,0,,"China, Australia, USA, China","3,4,4,3",4,4,4,1,1,"China University of Geosciences, University of Wales, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine",,,,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,China,Australia,USA,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['asian', 'white', 'white', 'asian']",2,0,0,2,0,4,4,0,50%,

Recently, this issue of fairness in predictions has attracted significant attention, as data-driven models are increasingly utilized to perform crucial decision-making tasks. Methods to achieve fairness in the machine learning literature typically build a single prediction model subject to some fairness criteria in a manner that encourages fair prediction performances for all groups. These approaches have two major limitations: i) fairness is often achieved by compromising accuracy for some groups; ii) the underlying relationship between dependent and independent variables may not be the same across groups. We propose a Joint Fairness Model (JFM) approach for binary outcomes that estimates group-specific classifiers using a joint modeling objective function that incorporates fairness criteria for prediction. We introduce an Accelerated Smoothing Proximal Gradient Algorithm to solve the convex objective function, and demonstrate the properties of the proposed JFM estimates. Next, we presented the key asymptotic properties for the JFM parameter estimates. We examined the efficacy of the JFM approach in achieving prediction performances and parities, in comparison with the Single Fairness Model, group-separate model, and group-ignorant model through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the JFM method in the motivating example to obtain fair risk predictions for under-represented older patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142367/,1,1,,,2021,0,1,NIA,"Biometrics

","Surgical innovation promises improvements in healthcare, but it also raises ethical issues including risks of harm to patients, conflicts of interest and increased injustice in access to health care. In this article, we focus on risks of injustice, and use a case study of robotic prostatectomy to identify features of surgical innovation that risk introducing or exacerbating injustices. Interpreting justice as encompassing matters of both efficiency and equity, we first examine questions relating to government decisions about whether to publicly fund access to innovative treatments. Here the case of robotic prostatectomy exemplifies the difficulty of accommodating healthcare priorities such as improving the health of marginalized groups. It also illustrates challenges with estimating the likely long-term costs and benefits of a new intervention, the difficulty of comparing outcomes of an innovative treatment to those of established treatments, and the further complexity associated with patient and surgeon preferences. Once the decision has been made to fund a new procedure, separate issues of justice arise at the level of providing care to individual patients. Here, the case of robotic prostatectomy exemplifies how features of surgical innovation, such as surgeon learning curves and the need for an adequate volume of cases at a treatment centre, can exacerbate injustices associated with treatment cost and the logistics of travelling for treatment. Drawing on our analysis, we conclude by making a number of recommendations for the just introduction of surgical innovations.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26871997/,1,0,,,2016,14,0,,,,0,White,Australia,4,"Macquarie University, Sydney,",Phd,0,1,white,Australia ,4,University of Adelaide ,Phd,0,,"Australia, Australia, Australia","4,4,4",3,3,3,1,1,"Macquarie University, Macquarie University, University of Adelaide","Phd, Phd, Phd","0,0,0",,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Australia,Australia,Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white']",3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,100%,

Integration of machine learning with clinical decision support tools, such as computerized alerts or diagnostic support, may offer physicians and others who provide health care targeted and timely information that can improve clinical decisions. Machine learning algorithms, however, may also be subject to biases. The biases include those related to missing data and patients not identified by algorithms, sample size and underestimation, and misclassification and measurement error. There is concern that biases and deficiencies in the data used by machine learning algorithms may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in health care. This Special Communication outlines the potential biases that may be introduced into machine learning-based clinical decision support tools that use electronic health record data and proposes potential solutions to the problems of overreliance on automation, algorithms based on biased data, and algorithms that do not provide information that is clinically meaningful.

While AI provides various opportunities for medical practice, there is an emerging consensus that the existing studies show considerable deficits and are unable to establish the clinical benefit of AI systems. Hence, the view that the clinical benefit of AI systems needs to be studied in clinical trials-particularly randomised controlled trials (RCTs)-is gaining ground. However, an issue that has been overlooked so far in the debate is that, compared with drug RCTs, AI RCTs require methodological adjustments, which entail ethical challenges. This paper sets out to develop a systematic account of the ethics of AI RCTs by focusing on the moral principles of clinical equipoise, informed consent and fairness.

The purpose of this study was to develop a new artificial intelligent model for surgery/non-surgery decision and extraction determination, and to evaluate the performance of this model. The sample used in this study consisted of 316 patients in total. Of the total sample, 160 were planned with surgical treatment and 156 were planned with non-surgical treatment. The input values of artificial neural network were obtained from 12 measurement values of the lateral cephalogram and 6 additional indexes. The artificial intelligent model of machine learning consisted of 2-layer neural network with one hidden layer. The learning was carried out in 3 stages, and 4 best performing models were adopted. Using these models, decision-making success rates of surgery/non-surgery, surgery type, and extraction/non-extraction were calculated. The final diagnosis success rate was calculated by comparing the actual diagnosis with the diagnosis obtained by the artificial intelligent model. The success rate of the model showed 96% for the diagnosis of surgery/non-surgery decision, and showed 91% for the detailed diagnosis of surgery type and extraction decision.

For instance, interactions in linearly-specified regression models are most often used to quantify intersecting identities, represented as product terms between identity categories such as sex-race interaction term(s). However, detection of these effects suffers from low power due to the often high-dimensional nature of these models, such as inclusion of many candidate regressors and/or sparse data conditions (del R√≠o-Gonz√°lez, Holt, & Bowleg, 2021). Approaches that better optimize power and precision in testing intersectional interactions are therefore crucial for improving the methodological rigor of investigating such theories of AUD. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging penalized regression models (PRMs) to improve estimation of categorical variable interactions representative of intersectional AUD risk. PRMs perform variable selection and/or introduce downward bias in model estimates in exchange for reducing their variance (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman, 2009; Helwig, 2017). We hypothesized that the application of these data mining methods would therefore mitigate the issue of imprecision in estimates of intersectional interactions in high-dimensional data, thus improving power in detecting such effects. We first developed a power simulation that compared tests of categorical variable interaction terms produced by standard linear models and PRMs. Conditions were designed to represent several complex data scenarios common in intersectional data (e.g., inclusion of numerous irrelevant regressors and sparse data conditions). We then tested risk for alcohol use involvement across intersections focused on race and sex in the ABCD study (e.g., Mennies, Birk, Norris, & Olino, 2021) comparing power using typical and PRM approaches. Results indicated that PRMs improved power to detect interactions present in the population by up to 40% compared to typical linear approaches. Improvements were strongest in scenarios where several irrelevant interactions were included as regressors in a model. Findings supported the value of PRMs in mitigating acknowledged limitations for testing interactions acknowledged in intersectional AUD research.","['alcoholism', 'conference abstract', 'controlled study', 'data mining', 'female', 'human', 'male', 'race', 'rigor', 'risk assessment', 'simulation', 'theoretical study']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acer.14628,1,1,,,2021,0,1,T32 AA013525,,,1,white,USA,4,Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center,Phd,0,1,white,Russia,4,Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center,Phd,0,,"USA, USA, USA, Russia","4,4,4,3",4,4,4,1,1,"Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center","Phd, Phd, Phd","0,0,0",,0,4,4,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,USA,USA,USA,Russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white', 'white', white]",4,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,100%,

It is the stated policy for gender equity in Papua New Guinea‚Äôs (PNG) health sector, as well as all other sectors, and is enshrined in the policies of its biggest aid givers. However, there is criticism that gender mainstreaming‚Äôs application has too often been technocratic and lacking in conceptual clarity not only in PNG but elsewhere. In the health sector this is further exacerbated by a traditional bio-medical approach, which is often paternalistic and insufficiently patient- and family-centered. Methods: This study analyses the policy attitudes toward gender in PNG‚Äôs health sector using both data-mining and a traditional, summative content analysis. Results: Our results show that gender is rarely mentioned. When it is, it is most often mentioned in relation to programs such as maternity and childcare for women, and elsewhere is applied technocratically. Conclusion: For PNG to promote greater levels of equity, the focus should first be on conceptualizing gender in a way that is meaningful for Papuans, taking into account the diversity of experiences and setting. Second, there should be greater focus on activists and civil society groups as the stakeholders most likely to make a difference in gender equity.","['article', 'content analysis', 'data mining', 'female', 'gender', 'health care access', 'health care delivery', 'health care policy', 'health equity', 'health service', 'human', 'male', 'Papua New Guinea', 'summative content analysis']",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-017-0555-5,1,1,,,2017,7,1,National Health and Medical Research Council,International Journal for Equity in Health,,0,white,Australia,4,Macquarie University,-,0,1,white,Australia,4,Macquarie University,Phd,0,,"Australia, Australia","4,4",2,2,2,1,1,"Macquarie University, Macquarie University","-,Phd",0,,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Australia,Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['white', 'white']",2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,100%,

These novel big data resources are applied across a variety of contexts-from health services research using data from insurance claims, cancer registries, and electronic health records, to deeper and broader genomic characterizations of disease. Several forms of big data show promise for improving our understanding of racial disparities in breast cancer, and for powering more intelligent and far-reaching interventions to close the racial gap in breast cancer survival. In this article we introduce several major types of big data used in breast cancer disparities research, highlight important findings to date, and discuss how big data may transform breast cancer disparities research in ways that lead to meaningful, lifesaving changes in breast cancer screening and treatment.
